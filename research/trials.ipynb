Since its inception as a simple handbook for local medical students and house staff,\\nthe \\nManual\\n has grown to be one of the best-selling medical texts in the world. Concurrently, the \\nManual\\n has\\ngrown in size and complexity, mirroring the practice of medicine.\\nFrom the first edition edited by Wayland MacFarlane in 1943, numerous revisions have occurred, transforming\\nthe \\nManual\\n from a short textbook to a portable reference, and now a text with both written and electronic forms\\nwith availability on portable electronic devices. Throughout the many revisions, however, the editors have sought\\nto retain the virtues that made the work a success from the start: a concise discussion of pathophysiology, an\\nevidence-based presentation of current therapies, and a sensible format. Additionally, with each new edition, the\\ncontent is carefully updated to reflect the ever-changing advances in medical technology and therapeutics.\\nThe Washington Manual\\n®\\n \\nof Medical Therapeutics\\n has established a tradition of excellence that we aspire to\\npreserve. No discussion of the \\nManual\\n would be complete without mention of the fantastic Washington\\nUniversity medicine house staff, fellows, medical students, and attendings with whom we work daily. Their\\nbrilliance, compassion, and dedication are truly remarkable and inspiring. We are honored that they turn to the\\nManual\\n for guidance. We are deeply indebted for the substantial support and direction that Dr. Tom De Fer, the\\nseries editor, provided in the creation of this edition of the \\nManual\\n. We also sincerely thank Katie Sharp and the\\neditorial staff at Wolters Kluwer for their assistance and patience with our busy schedules.\\nWe have had the honor and pleasure of serving as chief residents of Shatz-Strauss, Karl-Flance, Kipnis-\\nDaughaday, and North Campus firms, and the Primary Care Medicine Clinic in the Barnes-Jewish Center for\\nOutpatient Health. Our firm chiefs, Drs. Megan Wren, Emily Fondahn, Geoffrey Cislo, and E.-P. Barrette, have\\nbeen instrumental over the course of the year, serving as mentors and role models. Our program director, Dr.\\nMelvin Blanchard, provided guidance and support in the production of the \\nManual\\n. Our Chairman of Medicine,\\nDr. Vicky Fraser, served as an outstanding role model and provided support in the creation of this text. We thank\\nour families for their support, patience, and inspiration.

The antipsychotic haloperidol and\\nthe benzodiazepine lorazepam are commonly used in the acute management of these symptoms. Second-\\ngeneration antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole,\\npaliperidone) are alternative agents that may lead to decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms.

No laboratory or imaging tests help in establishing\\nthe diagnosis; however, they can help to rule out other etiologies.\\nTREATMENT\\nBenzodiazepines are frequently used in management of anxiety and insomnia. \\nTable 1-2\\n provides a list of\\nselected benzodiazepines and their common uses and dosages.\\nPharmacology: Most benzodiazepines undergo oxidation to active metabolites in the liver. Lorazepam,\\noxazepam, and temazepam undergo glucuronidation to inactive metabolites; therefore, these agents\\nmay be particularly useful in the elderly and in those with liver disease. Benzodiazepines with long half-\\nlives may accumulate substantially in the elderly, in whom the half-life may be increased manyfold.\\nDosages: Relief of anxiety and insomnia is achieved at the doses outlined in \\nTable 1-2\\n. Therapy\\nshould be started at the lowest recommended dosage with intermittent dosing schedules.\\nSide effects include drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, psychomotor impairment, and anterograde\\namnesia. Benzodiazepine toxicity is heightened by malnutrition, advanced age, hepatic disease and\\nconcomitant use of alcohol, other CNS depressants, and CYP3A4 inhibitors.

High event rates were seen in both study arms, and no\\nbenefit was seen with revascularization. Taken together, these studies suggest that the risk of adverse\\ncardiac events is not altered by attempts at preoperative revascularization, even in high-risk populations.\\nA notable possible exception are patients with left main disease, who appeared to have benefited from\\npreoperative revascularization in a subset analysis of the CARP trial data (\\nAm J Cardiol 2008;102:809\\n).\\nBased on these cumulative results, a strategy of routinely pursuing coronary revascularization as a\\nmethod of decreasing perioperative cardiac risk cannot be recommended.

Postoperative respiratory failure can be\\na life-threatening complication, with a 30-day mortality rate as high as 26.5% (\\nJ Am Coll Surg 2007;204:1188\\n).\\nRisk Factors\\nBoth patient-dependent and surgery-specific risk factors determine overall risk (\\nAnn Intern Med\\n2006;144:575\\n).\\nProcedure-related risk factors\\nSurgical site is generally considered the greatest determinant of risk of pulmonary complications, with upper\\nabdominal and thoracic surgeries associated with highest risk (\\nN Engl J Med 1999;340:937\\n). Neurosurgery\\nand surgeries involving the mouth and palate also impart increased risk (\\nAnn Surg 2000;232:242\\n; \\nJ Am Coll\\nSurg 2007;204:1188\\n).\\nDuration of surgery correlates positively with risk in multiple studies (\\nChest 1997;111:564\\n; \\nActa\\nAnaesthesiol Scand 2001;45:345\\n; \\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med 2003;167:741\\n).\\nType of anesthesia may influence pulmonary risk as well. Although somewhat controversial due to\\nconflicting data and study heterogeneity, it seems that neuraxial anesthesia affords reduced risk of\\npneumonia, respiratory failure, and possibly shortterm mortality in comparison to general anesthesia (\\nBr\\nMed J 2000;321:1493\\n; \\nLancet 2008;372(9638):562\\n).\\nPatient-dependent risk factors\\nCOPD has reliably been found to be a risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. Disease\\nseverity correlates with risk of serious complications (\\nChest 1993;104:1445\\n). However, even patients with\\nadvanced lung disease can safely undergo surgery if deemed medically necessary (\\nBr Med J 1975;3:670\\n;\\nArch Intern Med 1992;152:967\\n). In contradistinction to hepatic disease, there is no identified threshold that\\nprecludes surgery.\\nInterstitial lung disease likely places patients at elevated risk but is not well studied in patients undergoing\\ngeneral surgery (\\nChest 2007;132:1637\\n). Well-controlled asthma\\nand restrictive physiology associated with obesity do not appear to be significant risk factors (\\nAnn Intern\\nMed 2006;144:575\\n; \\nBr J Anaesth 2009;103(1):i57\\n).\\nPulmonary hypertension is associated with significant morbidity in patients undergoing surgery (\\nJ Am Coll\\nCardiol 2005;45:1691\\n; \\nBr J Anaesth 2007;99:184\\n).\\nData from the systematic review that formed the basis for the American College of Physicians guideline\\nregarding pulmonary risk stratification for noncardiothoracic surgery suggest that heart failure may increase\\nthe risk of pulmonary complications to a greater degree than that seen with COPD (pooled adjusted odds\\nratios 2.93 and 2.36, respectively) (\\nAnn Intern Med 2006;144:581\\n).\\nPoor general health status is associated with increased perioperative pulmonary risk. Multiple indices of\\ngeneral health status including degree of functional dependence and American Society of Anesthesiologists\\nclass have been linked to poor pulmonary outcomes (\\nAnn Intern Med 2006;144:581\\n). Odds ratios for\\npostoperative respiratory failure of 2.53 and 2.29 were observed for hypoalbuminemia (<3 g/dL) and\\nazotemia (BUN >30 mg/dL), respectively, in a large cohort (\\nAnn Surg 2000;232:242\\n).\\nThe above-mentioned systematic review for the American College of Physicians identified age >50 years as\\nan independent predictor of postoperative pulmonary complications after adjustment for age-related\\ncomorbidities; risk was noted to increase linearly with increasing age.

As with malignancy, risk appears to be dose-dependent and associated with\\nactive use (\\nChest 1998;113(4):883\\n; \\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med 2003;167:741\\n).\\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for perioperative\\ncomplications, both pulmonary and cardiac (\\nChest 2008;133:1128\\n). A meta-analysis showed that OSA\\nincreased the odds of various postoperative complications by a factor of 2-4 (\\nBr J Anaesth 2012;109:897\\n);\\nthe most frequent pulmonary complication appears to be hypoxemia (\\nAnesthesiology 2008;108:822\\n).\\nUnrecognized sleep apnea may pose an even greater risk (\\nMayo Clin Proc 2001;76:897\\n).

Although not an absolute\\ncontraindication to surgery, it seems prudent to postpone purely elective procedures until such infections\\nhave resolved.\\nA full smoking history should be obtained.\\nPatients should be questioned regarding symptoms potentially consistent with OSA (snoring, daytime\\nsomnolence, observed apneas).

Although obesity itself is not associated with postoperative\\npulmonary complications, prevalence of OSA increases with increasing BMI. Uncontrolled hypertension\\nmay also suggest undiagnosed sleep apnea. Measurement of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry\\nassists in risk stratification (\\nAnesthesiology 2010;113:1338\\n).\\nA Mallampati score should be determined. A study of 137 adults being evaluated for OSA found that\\nevery 1-point increase in the Mallampati score increased the odds of OSA by 2.5 (95% confidence\\ninterval 1.2-5.0) (\\nSleep 2006;29:903\\n).\\nAttention should be paid to evidence of chronic lung disease such as increased anteroposterior\\ndimension of the chest, digital clubbing, and the presence of adventitious lung sounds (see \\nChapter 9,\\nObstructive Lung Disease\\n, and \\nChapter 10, Pulmonary Diseases\\n). Persistent coughing after a voluntary\\ncough is also a marker of increased risk (\\n Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2003;167:741\\n).\\nAgain, signs of decompensated heart failure (see the section on \\nPreoperative Cardiac Evaluation\\n in this\"),\n",

The Arozullah respiratory failure\\nindex was based on multivariate analysis of a cohort of 81,719 patients and validated on another 99,390\\npatients. It offers the advantage of manual calculation at the bedside. The Gupta calculators for\\npostoperative pneumonia and respiratory failure are derived from a data set of 211,410 patients and\\nvalidated on another 257,385. Although considerably more complicated than the Arozullah index, these\\ncalculators are accessible online and may be downloaded for free.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nPulmonary function tests (PFTs)\\nThe value of preoperative PFTs is debatable outside of lung resection surgery, where its role is relatively\\nwell defined (see the section on \\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Chapter 9\\n, and the section on\\nLung Cancer in \\nChapter 22\\n). In other surgical contexts, measurements gleaned from PFTs either fail to\\npredict pulmonary complications or add little beyond what can be gathered clinically (\\n Chest\\n1997;111:1536\\n). Although routine PFTs do not appear warranted per the current guidelines (\\n Ann Intern\\nMed 2006;144:575\\n), they should be considered for patients with unexplained dyspnea or exercise\\nintolerance or for patients with known lung disease and an unclear baseline.\\nArterial blood gas (ABG) analysis\\nNo data exist that suggest that ABG results contribute to preoperative pulmonary risk estimation beyond\\nother clinically derived variables as discussed earlier. Nevertheless, an ABG should be obtained when\\notherwise indicated; for example, to determine if a patient's lung disease is compensated (see the section\\non \\nRespiratory Failure in Chapter 8\\n).\\nChest radiography\\nIn general, a chest radiograph is recommended only if otherwise indicated (e.g., for evaluation of\\nunexplained dyspnea). Many findings deemed abnormal are chronic and do not alter management (\\nCan J\\nAnesth 2005;52:568\\n).\\nTREATMENT\\nTreatment should be focused on modifiable patient-related and procedure-related risk factors.\\nThe effect of preoperative smoking cessation on pulmonary complications has been largely described in\\ncardiothoracic surgeries, where a benefit to quitting smoking at least\\n2 months prior to surgery has been shown (\\nMayo Clin Proc 1989;64:609\\n). The effect on a general\\nsurgical population is less clear, because most of the observed benefit in this latter group relates to\\nimprovements in nonpulmonary outcomes, such as fewer wound complications (\\nAnn Surg 2008;248:739\\n).\\nNevertheless, given the long-term benefits of smoking cessation, all patients should be counseled to stop\\nsmoking even if <8 weeks from surgery. Previous concerns about a paradoxical increase in complications\\nappear unfounded (\\nArch Intern Med 2011;171(11):983\\n).\\nCOPD and asthma therapy should be optimized (see \\nChapter 9, Obstructive Lung Disease\\n).\\nNonemergent surgery may need to be postponed to allow recovery of pulmonary function to baseline.\"),\n",

Case reports of presumed adrenal insufficiency from the 1950s led to the widespread use of\\nperioperative “stress-dose” steroids in this population (\\nJAMA 1952;149:1542\\n; \\nAnn Intern Med 1953;39:116\\n).\\nThe dose and duration of exogenous corticosteroids required to produce clinically significant tertiary adrenal\\ninsufficiency is highly variable, but general principles can be outlined (\\nMed Clin North Am 2003;87:175\\n).\\nDaily therapy with 5 mg or less of prednisone (or its equivalent), alternate-day corticosteroid therapy, and\\nany dose given for <3 weeks should not result in clinically significant adrenal suppression.\\nPatients receiving >20 mg/d prednisone (or equivalent) for >3 weeks and patients who are clinically\\n“cushingoid” in appearance can be expected to have significant suppression of adrenal responsiveness.\\nThe function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis cannot be readily predicted in patients receiving doses of\\nprednisone 5-20 mg for >3 weeks.\\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTING\\nCosyntropin stimulation test may also be performed to determine adrenal responsiveness, measuring cortisol\\nlevels at 30 minutes after 250 μg of cosyntropin. This can be done any time of day and there is no need for\\nbaseline cortisol. Levels >18 μg/dL at 30 minutes generally suggest an intact hypothalamic-pituitary axis.\\nTREATMENT\\nIf there is concern for secondary adrenal insufficiency, it is reasonable \\nto simply continue to provide\\nbaseline steroid supplementation\\n perioperatively (\\nArch Surg 2008; 143:1222\\n). It may be prudent to\\nswitch to an IV formulation to ensure it is not withheld while the patient is NPO.\\nFor patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, a stress stratification scheme has been developed, based\\non expert opinion.

Yen\\nNutrient Requirements\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nEnergy\\nTotal daily energy expenditure\\n (TEE) is composed of resting energy expenditure (normally ˜70% of TEE), the thermic effect of food (normally\\n˜10% of TEE), and energy expenditure of physical activity (normally ˜20% of TEE).\\nIt is impossible to determine \\ndaily energy requirements\\n precisely with predictive equations because of the complexity of factors that affect\\nmetabolic rate. Judicious use of predictive equations can provide a reasonable estimate that should be modified as needed based on the patient's\\nclinical course.\\nMalnutrition\\n and \\nhypocaloric feeding\\n may decrease resting energy expenditure to values 15-20% below those expected for actual body size,\\nwhereas metabolic stressors, such as inflammatory diseases or trauma, often increase energy requirements (usually by ˜50% of pre-illness\\nvalues).\\nThe \\nHarris-Benedict equation\\n provides a reasonable estimate of resting energy expenditure (in kilocalories [kcal] per day) in healthy adults. The\\nequation takes into account the effect of body size and lean tissue mass (which is influenced by gender and age) on energy requirements and can\\nbe used to estimate total daily energy needs in hospitalized patients:\\nMen = 66 + (13.7 × \\nW\\n) + (5 × \\nH\\n) - (6.8 × \\nA\\n)\\nWomen = 665 + (9.6 × \\nW\\n) + (1.8 × \\nH\\n) - (4.7 × \\nA\\n) where \\nW\\n is the weight in kilograms, \\nH\\n the height in centimeters, and \\nA\\n is the age in years\\n(\\nPublication No. 279. Carnegie Institute of Washington. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott, 1919:223\\n).\\nEnergy requirements per kilogram of body weight are inversely related to body mass index (BMI) (\\nTable 2-1\\n). The lower range within each\\ncategory should be considered in insulin-resistant, critically ill patients unless they are depleted in body fat.\\nIdeal body weight\\n can be estimated based on height:\\nFor men: 106 lb + 6 lb for each inch over 5 ft\\nFor women, 100 lb + 5 lb for each inch over 5 ft\\nProtein\\nProtein intake of 0.8 g/kg/d meets the requirements of 97% of the adult population.\\nProtein requirements are affected by several factors, such as the amount of nonprotein calories provided, overall energy requirements, protein\\nquality, the patient's baseline nutritional status, and the presence of metabolic stressors (\\nTable 2-2\\n).\\nInadequate amounts of any of the essential amino acids result in inefficient utilization.\\nIllness increases the efflux of amino acids from skeletal muscle; however, increasing protein intake to >1.2 g/kg/d of prehospitalization body weight\\nin critically ill patients may not reduce the loss of lean body mass (\\nCrit Care Med 1998;26(9):1529\\n).\\nEssential fatty acids\\nThe liver can synthesize most fatty acids, but humans lack the desaturase enzyme needed to produce the ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acid series.\\nTherefore, linoleic acid should constitute at least 2% and linolenic acid at least 0.5% of the daily caloric intake to prevent essential fatty acid\\ndeficiency.\\nTABLE 2-1 Estimated Energy Requirements for Hospitalized Patients Based on Body Mass Index\\nBody Mass Index (kg/m\\n2\\n)\\nEnergy Requirements (kcal/kg/d)\\n15\\n35-40\\n15-19\\n30-35\\n20-24\\n20-25\"),\n",

Copper deficiency is extremely common in post-gastric bypass patients who do not receive routine supplementation (\\nInt J Obes\\n(Lond) 2012;36(3):328\\n).\\nPatients with excessive gastrointestinal (GI) tract losses require additional fluids and electrolytes.\\nAn assessment of fluid losses due to diarrhea, ostomy output, and fistula volume should be made to help determine fluid requirements.

These formulas are not palatable and therefore require either tube feeding or mixing\\nwith other foods or flavorings for oral ingestion. Free amino acids are poorly absorbed, and these formulas have not been shown to be clinically\\nsuperior to oligomeric or polymeric formulas in patients with adequate\\npancreatic digestive function.

Although\\nnasogastric feeding is usually the most appropriate route, orogastric feeding may be needed in those who are intubated or in patients with nasal\\ninjury or deformity.

Alternatively, they can be placed surgically, depending on the clinical situation and local expertise.\\nFeeding schedules:\\n Patients who have feeding tubes in the stomach can often tolerate intermittent bolus or gravity feedings, in which the total\\namount of daily formula is divided into four to six equal portions.\\nBolus feedings\\n are given by syringe as rapidly as tolerated.\\nGravity feedings\\n are infused over 30-60 minutes.\\nThe patient's upper body should be elevated by 30-45 degrees during feeding and for at least 2 hours afterward. Tubes should be flushed with\\nwater after each feeding. Intermittent feedings are useful for patients who cannot be positioned with continuous head-of-the-bed elevation or who\\nrequire greater freedom from feeding. Patients who experience nausea and early satiety with bolus gravity feedings may require continuous\\ninfusion at a slower rate.\\nContinuous feeding\\n can often be started at 20-30 mL/h and advanced by 10 mL/h every 6 hours until the feeding goal is reached. Patients who\\nhave gastroparesis often tolerate gastric tube feedings when they are started at a slow rate (e.g., 10 mL/h) and advanced by small increments\\n(e.g., 10 mL/h every 8-12 hours).

Intubation of the tracheobronchial tree has been\\nreported in up to 15% of patients. Intracranial placement can occur in patients with skull fractures.\\nErosive tissue damage\\n can lead to nasopharyngeal erosions, pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, pneumothorax, and GI tract perforation.\\nTube occlusion\\n is often caused by inspissated feedings or pulverized medications given through small-diameter (<#10 French) tubes.\\nFrequent flushing of the tube with 30-60 mL of water and avoiding administration of pill fragments or “thick” medications help to prevent\\nocclusion. Techniques used to unclog tubes include the use of a small-volume syringe (10 mL) to flush warm water or pancreatic enzymes\\n(Viokase dissolved in water) through the tube.\\nHyperglycemia\\nThe precise level at which glucose should be maintained in hospitalized patients remains controversial.\\nSubcutaneously administered insulin can usually maintain good glycemic control. IV insulin drip protocols should be used to control blood\\nglucose in critically ill patients with anasarca or hemodynamic instability to ensure adequate insulin absorption.\\nIntermediate-duration insulin (e.g., NPH) can often be used safely once tube feedings reach 1000 kcal/d. Long-duration insulin (e.g., detemir,\\nglargine) should be used with caution in critically ill patients because changes in clinical status may affect pharmacokinetics and increase the\\nrisk of sustained hypoglycemia.\\nPatients who are receiving bolus feeds should receive short-acting insulin at the time of the feed.\\nPatients who are being given continuous (24 hours per day) feeding should receive intermediate-duration insulin every 8 hours when\\nclinically stable. If tube feeds are interrupted and insulin has been given, an infusion of dextrose-containing fluid should be given at a rate to\\nmatch the infusion rate of the scheduled tube feeds until the insulin has worn off.\\nPulmonary aspiration\\nThe etiology of \\npulmonary aspiration\\n can be difficult to determine in tube-fed patients because aspiration can occur from refluxed tube\\nfeedings or oropharyngeal secretions that are unrelated to feedings. Recent evidence suggests that oral secretions play a far greater role in\\nthe development of ventilator-associated pneumonia than aspiration of tube feedings (\\nJAMA 2013;309(3):249-56\\n).\\nAddition of food coloring to tube feeds \\nshould not be used\\n for the diagnosis of aspiration. This method is insensitive for diagnosis, and\\nseveral case reports suggest that food coloring can be absorbed by the GI tract in critically ill patients and can lead to serious complications\\nand death (\\nN Engl J Med 2000;343:1047\\n).\\nGastric residuals are poorly predictive of aspiration risk.\\nPrevention of reflux: Decrease gastric acid secretion with pharmacologic therapy (H2 blocker, proton pump inhibitor), elevate head of bed\\nduring feeds, and avoid gastric feeding in high-risk patients (e.g., those with gastroparesis, frequent vomiting, gastric outlet obstruction).\\nGI complications\\nNausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common.\\nDiarrhea\\n is often associated with antibiotic therapy (\\nJPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr 1991;15:27\\n) and the use of liquid medications that contain\\nnonabsorbable carbohydrates, such as sorbitol (\\nAm J Med 1990;88:91\\n). If diarrhea from tube feeding persists after proper evaluation of\\npossible causes, a trial of antidiarrheal agents or fiber is\\njustified. Diarrhea is common in patients who receive tube feeding and occurs in up to 50% of critically ill patients.\\nDiarrhea in patients with short gut, who do not have other causes such as \\nClostridium difficile\\n infection, may be minimized by use of small,\\nfrequent meals that do not contain concentrated sweets (e.g., soda). Intestinal transit time should be maximized to allow nutrient absorption\\nusing tincture of opium, loperamide, or diphenoxylate. Lowdose clonidine (0.025-0.05 mg orally bid) may be used to reduce diarrhea in\\nhemodynamically stable patients with short bowel syndrome (\\nJPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr 2004;28(4):265\\n).\\nIntestinal ischemia/necrosis\\n has been reported in patients receiving tube feeding. These cases have occurred predominantly in critically ill\\npatients receiving vasopressors for blood pressure support in conjunction with enteral feeding. There are no reliable clinical signs for\\ndiagnosis, and the mortality rate is high. \\nCaution should be used when enterally feeding critically ill patients requiring vasopressors.\\nParenteral Nutrition\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nParenteral nutrition should be considered if energy intake cannot, or it is anticipated that it cannot, be met by enteral nutrition (<50% of daily\\nrequirements) for more than 7-10 days. This guideline originates from two intensive care unit (ICU)-focused meta-analyses citing increased\\ncomplications (\\nAm J Clin Nutr 2001;74:534\\n) and increased overall mortality (\\nJAMA 1998;280:2013\\n) in ICU patients receiving early parenteral'),\n",

Recent\\nstudies have found that critically ill patients who are unable to meet caloric goals by enteral nutrition alone for the first 8 days of hospitalization have\\nlonger durations of stay and greater mortality rates than those in whom total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is withheld for the first 8 days after admission\\n(\\nN Engl J Med 2011;365:506\\n).\\nRecommendations\\nCentral parenteral nutrition (CPN)\\nThe infusion of hyperosmolar (usually >1500 mOsm/L) nutrient solutions requires a large-bore, high-flow vessel to minimize vessel irritation and\\ndamage.\\nPercutaneous subclavian vein \\ncatheterization\\n and peripherally inserted central venous catheterization (PICC) are the most commonly used\\ntechniques for CPN access. The internal jugular, saphenous, and femoral veins are also used, although they are less desirable due to\\ndecreased patient comfort and difficulty in maintaining sterility. Tunneled catheters are preferred in patients who are likely to receive >8 weeks\\nof TPN to reduce the risk of mechanical failure.\\nPICCs (which reduce the risk of pneumothorax) are increasingly used to provide CPN in patients with adequate antecubital vein access. These\\ncatheters are not suitable for patients in whom CPN is anticipated to be necessary for an extended duration (>6 months).\\nCPN macronutrient solutions\\nCrystalline \\namino acid solutions\\n containing 40-50% essential and 50-60% nonessential amino acids (usually with little or no glutamine,\\nglutamate, aspartate, asparagine, tyrosine, and cysteine) are used to provide protein needs (\\nTable 2-2\\n). Infused amino acids are oxidized and\\nshould be included in the estimate of energy provided as part of the parenteral formulation.\\nSome amino acid solutions have been modified for specific disease states such as those enriched in branched-chain amino acids for use in\\npatients who have hepatic\\nencephalopathy and solutions that contain mostly essential amino acids for use in patients with renal insufficiency.\\nGlucose\\n (dextrose) in IV solutions is hydrated; each gram of dextrose monohydrate provides 3.4 kcal. Although there is no absolute\\nrequirement for glucose in most patients, providing >150 g of glucose per day maximizes protein balance.\\nLipid emulsions\\n are available as a 10% (1.1 kcal/mL) or 20% (2.0 kcal/mL) solution and provide energy as well as a source of essential fatty\\nacids. Emulsion particles are similar in size and structure to chylomicrons and are metabolized like nascent chylomicrons after acquiring\\napoproteins from contact with circulating endogenous high-density lipoprotein cholesterol particles. Lipid emulsions are as effective as glucose\\nin conserving body nitrogen economy once absolute tissue requirements for glucose are met. The optimal percentage of calories that should be\\ninfused as fat is not known, but 20-30% of total calories is reasonable for most patients. The rate of infusion should not exceed 1.0 kcal/kg/h\\n(0.11 g/kg/h) because most complications associated with lipid infusions have been reported when providing more than this amount (\\nCurr Opin\\nGastroenterol 1991;7:306\\n). A rate of 0.03-0.05 g/kg/h is adequate for most patients who are receiving continuous CPN. Lipid emulsions should\\nnot be given to patients who have triglyceride concentrations of >400 mg/dL. Moreover, patients at risk for hypertriglyceridemia should have\\nserum triglyceride concentrations checked at least once during lipid emulsion infusion to ensure adequate clearance. Underfeeding obese\\npatients by the amount of lipid calories that would normally be given (e.g., 20-30% of calories) facilitates mobilization of endogenous fat stores\\nfor fuel and may improve insulin sensitivity. IV lipids should still be administered twice per week to these patients to provide essential fatty acids.\\nPeripheral parenteral nutrition\\nPeripheral parenteral nutrition is often considered to have limited usefulness because of the high risk of thrombophlebitis.\\nAppropriate adjustments in the management of peripheral parenteral nutrition can increase the life of a single infusion site to >10 days. The\\nfollowing guidelines are recommended:\\nProvide at least 50% of total energy as a lipid emulsion piggybacked with the dextrose-amino acid solution.\\nAdd 500-1000 units of heparin and 5 mg of hydrocortisone per liter (to decrease phlebitis).\\nPlace a fine-bore 22- or 23-gauge polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated polyurethane catheter in as large a vein as possible in the proximal forearm\\nusing sterile technique.\\nPlace a 5-mg glycerol trinitrate ointment patch (or 0.25 inch of 2% nitroglycerin ointment) over the infusion site.\\nInfuse the solution with a volumetric pump.\\nKeep the total infused volume <3500 mL/d.\\nFilter the solution with an inline 1.2-m filter (\\nNutrition 1994;10:49\\n).\\nLong-term home parenteral nutrition\\nLong-term home parenteral nutrition is usually given through a \\ntunneled catheter\\n or an implantable subcutaneous port inserted in the subclavian\\nvein.\\nNutrient formulations\\n can be infused overnight to permit daytime activities in patients who are able to tolerate the fluid load.

Management of patients with hyperglycemia or type 2 diabetes (\\nMayo Clin Proc 1996;71:587\\n) can be\\nperformed in the following way:\\nIf blood glucose is >200 mg/dL, consider obtaining better control of blood glucose before starting CPN.\\nIf CPN is started, (a) limit dextrose to <200 g/d, (b) add 0.1 unit of regular insulin for each gram of dextrose in CPN solution (e.g., 15 units\\nfor 150 g), (c) discontinue other sources of IV dextrose, and (d) order routine, regular insulin with blood glucose monitoring by fingerstick\\nevery 4-6 hours or IV regular insulin infusion with blood glucose monitoring by fingerstick every 1-2 hours.\\nIn outpatients who use insulin, an estimate of the reduction in blood sugar that will be caused by the administration of 1 unit of insulin may\\nbe calculated by dividing 1500 by the total daily insulin dose (e.g., for a patient receiving 50 units of insulin as an outpatient, 1 unit of\\ninsulin may be predicted to reduce plasma glucose concentration by 1500/50 = 30 mg/dL).\\nIf blood glucose remains >200 mg/dL and the patient has been requiring SC insulin, add 50% of the supplemental short-acting insulin\\ngiven in the last 24 hours to the next day's CPN solution and double the amount of SC insulin sliding-scale dose for blood glucose values\\n>200 mg/dL.\\nThe insulin-to-dextrose ratio in the CPN formulation should be maintained while the CPN dextrose content is changed.\\nInfectious complications\\nCatheter-related sepsis is the most common life-threatening complication in patients who receive CPN and is most commonly caused by skin\\nflora: \\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\\n and \\nStaphylococcus aureus.\\nIn \\nimmunocompromised patients\\n and those with long-term (>2 weeks) CPN, \\nEnterococcus\\n, \\nCandida\\n species, \\nEscherichia coli\\n,\\nPseudomonas\\n, \\nKlebsiella\\n, \\nEnterobacter\\n, \\nAcinetobacter\\n, \\nProteus\\n, and \\nXanthomonas\\n should be considered.\\nThe principles of \\nevaluation and management\\n of suspected catheter-related infection are outlined in \\nChapter 14, Treatment of Infectious\\nDiseases\\n.\\nAlthough antibiotics are often infused through the central line, the \\nantibiotic lock technique\\n has been used successfully to treat and\\nprevent central catheter-related infections (\\nNutrition 1998;14:466\\n; \\nAntimicrob Agents Chemother 1999;43:2200\\n).

Brown\\nDaniel S. Kim\\nClare E. Moynihan\\nAnne C. Goldberg\\nHypertension\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nDefinition\\nHypertension\\n is defined as the presence of a blood pressure (BP) elevation to a level that places patients at increased risk for target\\norgan damage in several vascular beds including the retina, brain, heart, kidneys, and large conduit arteries (\\nTable 3-1\\n, \\nTable 3-2\\n).\\nClassification\\nNormal BP\\n is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) <120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <80 mm Hg; pharmacologic\\nintervention is not indicated.\\nPrehypertension\\n is defined as SBP of 120-139 mm Hg or DBP of 80-89 mm Hg. These patients should engage in comprehensive lifestyle\\nmodifications to delay progression or prevent the development of hypertension. Pharmacologic therapy should be initiated in\\nprehypertensive patients with evidence of target organ damage or diabetes.\\nIn stage 1\\n (SBP 140-159 mm Hg or DBP 90-99 mm Hg) \\nand stage 2\\n (SBP >160 mm Hg or DBP >100 mm Hg) \\nhypertension\\n,\\npharmacologic therapy should be initiated in addition to lifestyle modification to lower BP to <140/90 mm Hg in patients without diabetes or\\nchronic kidney disease and age <60 years. For those age ≥60 years without diabetes or chronic kidney disease, pharmacologic therapy\\nshould be initiated in addition to lifestyle modification to lower BP to >150/90 mm Hg. In patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease\\nand age ≥18 years, BP should be lowered to <140/90 mm Hg.\\nPatients with BP levels >20/10 mm Hg above their treatment target will often require more than one medication to achieve adequate\\ncontrol, and a two-drug regimen may be initiated as initial therapy. Patients with an average BP of 200/120 mm Hg or greater require\\nimmediate therapy and, if symptomatic end-organ damage is present, hospitalization.\\nHypertensive crisis\\n includes hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. It usually develops in patients with a previous history of elevated\\nBP but may arise in those who were previously normotensive. The severity of a hypertensive crisis correlates not only with the absolute\\nlevel of BP elevation but also with the rapidity of development because autoregulatory mechanisms have not had sufficient time to adapt.\\nHypertensive urgencies\\n are defined as a substantial increase in BP, usually with a DBP >120 mm Hg, and occur in approximately 1%\\nof hypertensive patients. Hypertensive urgencies (i.e., upper levels of stage 2 hypertension, hypertension with optic disk edema,\\nprogressive end-organ complications rather than damage, and severe perioperative hypertension) warrant BP reduction within several\\nhours (\\nJAMA 2003;289:2560\\n).\\nHypertensive emergencies\\n include \\naccelerated hypertension\\n, typically defined as an SBP >210 mm Hg and DBP >130 mm Hg\\npresenting with headaches, blurred vision, or focal neurologic symptoms and \\nmalignant hypertension\\n (which requires the presence of\\npapilledema). Hypertensive emergencies require immediate BP reduction by 20-25% to prevent or minimize end-organ damage (i.e.,\\nhypertensive encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, unstable angina [UA] pectoris, acute myocardial infarction [MI], acute left\\nventricular failure with pulmonary edema, dissecting aortic aneurysm, progressive renal failure, or eclampsia).\\nIsolated systolic hypertension\\n, defined as an SBP >140 mm Hg and normal DBP, occurs frequently in the elderly (beginning after the\\nfifth decade and increasing with age).\\nNonpharmacologic therapy should be initiated with medications added as needed to lower SBP to the appropriate level based on age and\\ncomorbidities.\\nTABLE 3-1 Manifestations of Target Organ Disease\\nOrgan System\\nManifestation'),\n",

A calibrated, appropriately fitting BP cuff (inflatable bladder encircling at least\\n80% of the arm) should be used because falsely high readings can be obtained if the cuff is too small.\\nTwo readings should be taken, separated by 2 minutes. SBP should be noted with the appearance of Korotkoff sounds (phase I) and\\nDBP with the disappearance of sounds (phase V).\\nIn certain patients, the Korotkoff sounds do not disappear but are present at 0 mm Hg. In this case, the initial muffling of Korotkoff\\nsounds (phase IV) should be taken as the DBP. One should be careful to avoid reporting spuriously low BP readings due to an\\nauscultatory gap, which is caused by the disappearance and reappearance of Korotkoff sounds in hypertensive patients and may\\naccount for up to a 25-mm Hg gap between true and measured SBP. Hypertension should be confirmed in both arms, and the higher\\nreading should be used.\\nHistory\\nHistory should seek to discover secondary causes of hypertension and note the presence of medications and supplements that can\\naffect BP (e.g., decongestants, oral contraceptives, appetite suppressants, sympathomimetics, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants,\\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], chlorpromazine, some herbal supplements [ma huang], steroids, NSAIDs, cyclosporine,\\ncaffeine, thyroid hormones, cocaine, alcohol use, erythropoietin).\\nA diagnosis of secondary hypertension should be considered in the following situations:\\nAge at onset younger than 30 or older than 60 years\\nHypertension that is difficult to control after therapy has been initiated\\nStable hypertension that becomes difficult to control\\nClinical occurrence of a hypertensive crisis\\nThe presence of signs or symptoms of a secondary cause such as hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis that is not explained by\\ndiuretic therapy\\nIn patients who present with significant hypertension at a young age, a careful family history may give clues to forms of hypertension\\nthat follow simple Mendelian inheritance.\\nPhysical Examination\\nPhysical examination should include investigation for target organ damage or a secondary cause of hypertension by noting the presence\\nof carotid bruits, an S3 or S4, cardiac murmurs, neurologic deficits, elevated jugular venous pressure, rales, retinopathy, unequal\\npulses, enlarged or small kidneys, cushingoid features, and abdominal bruits. Overweight/obesity should be assessed by measurement\\nof height and weight and/or abdominal waist circumference.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nHypertension may be part of several important syndromes of withdrawal from drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, and opioid\\nanalgesics. Rebound increases in BP also may be seen in patients who abruptly discontinue antihypertensive therapy,\\nparticularly β-adrenergic antagonists and central α\\n2\\n-agonists (see \\nComplications\\n).\\nCocaine and other sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., amphetamines, phencyclidine hydrochloride) can produce hypertension in the\\nsetting of acute intoxication and when the agents are discontinued abruptly after chronic use. Hypertension is often complicated\\nby other end-organ insults, such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and seizures. Phentolamine is effective in acute\\nmanagement, and sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin can be used as an alternative. β-Adrenergic antagonists should be\\navoided due to the risk of unopposed α-adrenergic activity, which can exacerbate hypertension.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nTests are needed to help identify patients with possible target organ damage, to help assess cardiovascular risk, and to provide a\\nbaseline for monitoring the adverse effects of therapy.\\nBasic laboratory data should include urinalysis, hematocrit, plasma glucose, serum potassium, serum creatinine, calcium, and uric\\nacid and fasting lipid levels.\\nOther testing includes ECG and chest radiography. Echocardiography may be of value for certain patients to assess cardiac function\\nor detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).'),\n",

SBP >140 mm Hg is associated with\\nincreased cerebrovascular and cardiac events.\\nIn patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes, BP should be reduced to a goal of <140/90 mm Hg.\\nIn patients age ≥60 without chronic kidney disease or diabetes, BP should be reduced to a goal of <150/90 mm Hg. Discretion is\\nwarranted in prescribing medication to lower BP that may affect cardiovascular risk adversely in other ways (e.g., glucose control,\\nlipid metabolism, uric acid levels).\\nIn the absence of hypertensive crisis, BP should be reduced gradually to avoid end-organ (e.g., cerebral) ischemia.\\nLifestyle modifications should be encouraged in all hypertensive patients regardless of whether they require medication (\\nTable 3-3\\n).\\nThese changes may have beneficial effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. Some of these lifestyle modifications include\\ncessation of smoking, reduction in body weight if the patient is overweight, judicious consumption of alcohol, adequate nutritional\\nintake of minerals and vitamins, reduction in sodium intake, and increased physical activity.\\nTABLE 3-3 Lifestyle Modifications and Effects\\nModification\\nApproximate SBP Reduction\\nWeight reduction (for every 10-kg weight loss)\\n5-20 mm Hg\\nAdoption of DASH eating plan\\n8-14 mm Hg\\nDietary sodium reduction (intake <2 g/d)\\n2-8 mm Hg\\nPhysical activity (150 min/wk)\\n4-9 mm Hg\\nModeration of alcohol consumption (intake <2 drinks/d)\\n2-4 mm Hg\\nDASH, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\\nBarring an overt need for immediate pharmacologic therapy, most patients should be given the opportunity to achieve a reduction in\\nBP over an interval of 3-6 months by applying nonpharmacologic modifications and pharmacologic therapies if needed.\\nMedications\\nInitial drug therapy\\nInitial drug choice may be affected by coexistent factors such as age, race, angina, HF, renal insufficiency, LVH, obesity,\\nhyperlipidemia, gout, and bronchospasm. Cost and drug interactions should also be considered. The BP response is usually\\nconsistent within a given class of agents; therefore, if a drug fails to control BP, another agent from the same class is unlikely to be\\neffective. At times, however, a change within drug class may be useful in reducing adverse effects. The lowest possible effective\\ndosage should be used to control BP, adjusted every 1-2 months as needed (\\nTable 3-4\\n).\\nDiuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers\\n(ARBs) should be considered first-line therapy for the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes (those with\\nchronic kidney disease are discussed below). Multiple large randomized controlled trials have shown comparable effects on\\ndecreasing overall cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality for all four drug classes (\\nJAMA 2014;311(5):507\\n).\\nIn the general black population, including those with diabetes, a diuretic or CCB can be considered for first-line therapy. Data\\nfrom the ALLHAT trial have shown decreased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality with the use of thiazide\\ndiuretics or CCB over an ACE inhibitor (\\nJAMA 2002;288:2981\\n).\\nIn patients with chronic kidney disease, initial or combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB should be considered.\\nAdditional therapy.\\n When a second drug is needed, it should generally be chosen from among the other first-line agents.\\nAdjustments of a therapeutic regimen.\\n Before considering a modification of therapy because of inadequate response to the\\ncurrent regimen, other possible contributing factors should be investigated.

Assume all drugs are available in generic form unless otherwise denoted by superscript “\\nb\\n.”\\nc\\nRenal function should be considered for all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors before initiation.\\nDiuretics\\n (see \\nTable 3-4\\n) are effective agents in the therapy of hypertension and have been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke\\nand cardiovascular events. Several classes of diuretics are available, generally categorized by their site of action in the kidney.\\nThiazide\\n and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) block sodium reabsorption predominantly in the distal\\nconvoluted tubule by inhibition of the thiazide-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter. Thiazide diuretics can produce weakness, muscle\\ncramps, and impotence. Metabolic side effects include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperlipidemia (with increases in low-density\\nlipoproteins [LDLs] and triglyceride levels), hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, and rarely, azotemia.\\nThiazide-induced pancreatitis has also been reported. Metabolic side effects may be limited when thiazides are used in low doses\\n(e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5-25.0 mg/d).\\nLoop diuretics\\n (e.g., furosemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, torsemide) block sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of\\nHenle through inhibition of the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter and are the most effective agents in patients with renal insufficiency (estimated\\nglomerular filtration rate <35 mL/min/1.73 m\\n2\\n). Loop diuretics can cause electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesemia,\\nhypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, and can also produce irreversible ototoxicity (usually dose related and more common with parenteral\\ntherapy).\\nSpironolactone and eplerenone, potassium-sparing agents\\n, act by competitively inhibiting the actions of aldosterone on the\\nkidney. Triamterene and amiloride are potassium-sparing drugs that inhibit the epithelial Na\\n+\\n channel in the distal nephron to inhibit\\nreabsorption of Na\\n+\\n and secretion of potassium ions. Potassium-sparing diuretics are weak agents when used alone; thus, they are\\noften combined with a thiazide for added potency. Aldosterone antagonists may have an additional benefit in improving myocardial\\nfunction in HF; this effect may be independent of its effect on renal transport mechanisms. Spironolactone and eplerenone can\\nproduce hyperkalemia; however, the gynecomastia that may occur in men and breast tenderness in women are not seen with\\neplerenone. Triamterene (usually in combination with hydrochlorothiazide) can cause renal tubular damage and renal calculi. Unlike\\nthiazides, potassium-sparing and loop diuretics do not cause adverse lipid effects.\\nCalcium channel antagonists\\n (see \\nTable 3-4\\n) generally have no significant central nervous system (CNS) side effects and can be\\nused to treat diseases, such as angina pectoris, that can coexist with hypertension. \\nDue to the concern that the use of short-\\nacting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may increase the number of ischemic cardiac events, they are not\\nindicated for hypertension management\\n (\\n JAMA 1995;274:620\\n); long-acting agents are considered safe in the management of\\nhypertension (\\n Am J Cardiol 1996;77:81\\n).\\nClasses of calcium channel antagonists\\n include diphenylalkylamines (e.g., verapamil), benzothiazepines (e.g., diltiazem), and\\ndihydropyridines (e.g., nifedipine). The dihydropyridines include many newer second-generation drugs (e.g., amlodipine, felodipine,\\nisradipine, and nicardipine), which are more vasoselective and have longer plasma half-lives than nifedipine. Verapamil and\\ndiltiazem have negative cardiac inotropic and chronotropic effects. Nifedipine also has a negative inotropic effect, but in clinical\\nuse, this effect is much less pronounced than that of verapamil or diltiazem because of peripheral vasodilation and reflex\\ntachycardia. Less negative inotropic effects have been observed with the second-generation dihydropyridines. All calcium channel'),\n",

Some of\\nthese drugs also inhibit the metabolism of other hepatically cleared medications (e.g., cyclosporine). Verapamil and diltiazem should\\nbe used with caution in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities, and they can worsen HF in patients with decreased left\\nventricular function.\\nSide effects\\n of verapamil include constipation, nausea, headache, and orthostatic hypotension. Diltiazem can cause nausea,\\nheadache, and rash. Dihydropyridines can cause lower extremity edema, flushing, headache, and rash. Calcium channel\\nantagonists have no significant effects on glucose tolerance, electrolytes, or lipid profiles.\\nInhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system\\n (see \\nTable 3-4\\n) include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and a direct renin inhibitor.\\nACE inhibitors\\n may have beneficial effects in patients with concomitant HF or kidney disease. One study has also suggested that\\nACE inhibitors (ramipril) may significantly reduce the rate of death, MI, and stroke in patients without HF or low ejection fraction (\\nN\\nEngl J Med 2000;342:145\\n). Additionally, they can reduce hypokalemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia\\ncaused by diuretic therapy and are particularly effective in states of hypertension associated with a high renin state (e.g.,\\nscleroderma renal crisis). \\nSide effects\\n associated with the use of ACE inhibitors are infrequent. They can cause a dry cough (up\\nto 20% of patients), angioneurotic edema, and hypotension, but they do not cause levels of lipids, glucose, or uric acid to increase.\\nACE inhibitors that contain a sulfhydryl group (e.g., captopril) may cause taste disturbance, leukopenia, and a glomerulopathy with\\nproteinuria. Because ACE inhibitors cause preferential vasodilation of the efferent arteriole in the kidney, worsening of renal\\nfunction may occur in patients who have decreased renal perfusion or who have preexisting severe renal insufficiency. ACE\\ninhibitors can cause hyperkalemia and should be used with caution in patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\\nwho are taking potassium supplements or who are receiving potassium-sparing diuretics.\\nARBs\\n are a class of antihypertensive drugs that are effective in diverse patient populations (\\nN Engl J Med 1996;334:1649\\n). ARBs\\nare useful alternatives in patients with HF who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors (\\nN Engl J Med 2001;345:1667\\n). \\nSide effects\\nof ARBs occur rarely but include angioedema, allergic reaction, and rash.\\nThe \\ndirect renin inhibitor\\n class consists of one agent, aliskiren, that is indicated solely for the treatment of hypertension (see\\nTable 3-4\\n). It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents; however, combined use with ACE inhibitors or ARBs\\nis contraindicated in patients with diabetes (\\n Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Drug Safety Communication, April 2012\\n).\\nβ-Adrenergic antagonists\\n (see \\nTable 3-4\\n) are part of medical regimens that have been proven to decrease the incidence of stroke,\\nMI, and HF. β-Adrenergic antagonists work via competitive inhibition of the effects of catecholamines at β-adrenergic receptors, which\\ndecreases heart rate and cardiac output. These agents also decrease plasma renin and cause a resetting of baroreceptors to accept\\na lower level of BP. β-Adrenergic antagonists cause release of vasodilatory prostaglandins, decrease plasma volume, and may also\\nhave a CNS-mediated antihypertensive effect.\\nClasses of β-adrenergic antagonists\\n can be subdivided into those that are cardioselective, with primarily β\\n1\\n-blocking effects,\\nand those that are nonselective, with β\\n1\\n- and β\\n2\\n-blocking effects. At low doses, the cardioselective agents can be given with\\ncaution to patients with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), or peripheral vascular disease. At\\nhigher doses, these agents lose their β\\n1\\n selectivity and may cause unwanted effects in these patients. β-Adrenergic antagonists\\ncan also be categorized according to the presence or absence of partial agonist or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). β-\\nAdrenergic antagonists with ISA cause less bradycardia than do those without it. In addition, there are agents with mixed properties\\nhaving both α- and β-adrenergic antagonist actions (labetalol and carvedilol). Nebivolol is a highly selective β-adrenergic\\nantagonist that is vasodilatory through an unclear mechanism.\\nSide effects\\n include high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, HF, Raynaud phenomenon, and impotence. Lipophilic β-adrenergic\\nantagonists, such as propranolol, have a\\nhigher incidence of CNS side effects including insomnia and depression. Propranolol can also cause nasal congestion. β-\\nAdrenergic antagonists can cause adverse effects on the lipid profile; increased triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein\\n(HDL) levels occur mainly with nonselective β-adrenergic antagonists but generally do not occur when β-adrenergic antagonists\\nwith ISA are used. Pindolol, a selective β-adrenergic antagonist with ISA, may actually increase HDL and nominally increase\\ntriglycerides. Side effects of labetalol include hepatocellular damage, postural hypotension, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA)\\ntest, a lupus-like syndrome, tremors, and potential hypotension in the setting of halothane anesthesia. Carvedilol appears to have a\\nsimilar side effect profile to other β-adrenergic antagonists. Both labetalol and carvedilol have negligible effects on lipids. Rarely,\\nreflex tachycardia may occur because of the initial vasodilatory effect of labetalol and carvedilol. Because β-receptor density is\\nincreased with chronic antagonism, abrupt withdrawal of these agents can precipitate angina pectoris, increases in BP, and other\\neffects attributable to an increase in adrenergic tone.\\nSelective α-adrenergic antagonists\\n such as prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin have replaced nonselective α-adrenergic\\nantagonists such as phenoxybenzamine (see \\nTable 3-4\\n) in the treatment of essential hypertension. Based on the ALLHAT trial, these\\ndrugs appear to be less efficacious than diuretics, CCBs, and ACE inhibitors in reducing primary end points of cardiovascular disease'),\n",

Selective α\\n1\\n-adrenergic antagonists can cause syncope, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, headache, and\\ndrowsiness. In most cases, side effects are self-limited and do not recur with continued therapy. Selective α\\n1\\n-adrenergic antagonists\\nmay improve lipid profiles by decreasing total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increasing HDL levels. Additionally, these agents\\ncan improve the negative effects on lipids induced by thiazide diuretics and β-adrenergic antagonists. Doxazosin specifically may be\\nless effective at lowering SBP than thiazide diuretics and may be associated with a higher risk of HF and stroke in patients with\\nhypertension and at least one additional risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) (\\nJAMA 2002;283:1967\\n).\\nCentrally acting adrenergic agents\\n (see \\nTable 3-4\\n) are potent antihypertensive agents. In addition to its oral dosage forms,\\nclonidine is available as a transdermal patch that is applied weekly.\\nSide effects\\n may include bradycardia, drowsiness, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension, galactorrhea, and sexual dysfunction.\\nTransdermal clonidine causes a rash in up to 20% of patients. These agents can precipitate HF in patients with decreased left\\nventricular function, and abrupt cessation can precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome (AWS) of elevated BP, tachycardia, and\\ndiaphoresis. Methyldopa produces a positive direct antibody (Coombs) test in up to 25% of patients, but significant hemolytic anemia\\nis much less common. If hemolytic anemia develops secondary to methyldopa, the drug should be withdrawn. Severe cases of\\nhemolytic anemia may require treatment with glucocorticoids. Methyldopa also causes positive ANA test results in approximately 10%\\nof patients and can cause an inflammatory reaction in the liver that is indistinguishable from viral hepatitis; fatal hepatitis has been\\nreported. Guanabenz and guanfacine decrease total cholesterol levels, and guanfacine can also decrease serum triglyceride levels.\\nDirect-acting vasodilators\\n are potent antihypertensive agents (see \\nTable 3-4\\n) now reserved for refractory hypertension or specific\\ncircumstances such as the use of hydralazine in pregnancy.\\nHydralazine in combination with nitrates is useful in treating patients with hypertension and HF with reduced ejection fraction (see\\nChapter 5, Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy\\n). \\nSide effects\\n of hydralazine therapy may include headache, nausea,\\nemesis, tachycardia, and postural hypotension. Asymptomatic patients may have a positive ANA test result, and a hydralazine-\\ninduced systemic lupus-like syndrome may develop in approximately 10% of patients. Patients at greater risk for the latter\\ncomplication include those treated with excessive doses (e.g., >400 mg/d), those with impaired renal or cardiac function, and those\\nwith the slow acetylation phenotype. Hydralazine should be discontinued if clinical evidence of a lupus-like syndrome develops and\\na positive ANA test result is present. The syndrome usually resolves with discontinuation of the drug, leaving no adverse long-term\\neffects.\\nSide effects\\n of minoxidil include weight gain, hypertrichosis, hirsutism, ECG abnormalities, and pericardial effusions.\\nReserpine, guanethidine, and guanadrel\\n (see \\nTable 3-4\\n) were among the first effective antihypertensive agents available.\\nCurrently, these drugs are not regarded as first- or second-line therapy because of their significant side effects.\\nSide effects\\n of reserpine include severe depression in approximately 2% of patients. Sedation and nasal stuffiness also are potential\\nside effects. Guanethidine can cause severe postural hypotension through a decrease in cardiac output, a decrease in peripheral\\nresistance, and venous pooling in the extremities. Patients who are receiving guanethidine with orthostatic hypotension should be\\ncautioned to arise slowly and to wear support hose. Guanethidine can also cause ejaculatory failure and diarrhea.\\nParenteral antihypertensive agents\\n are indicated for the immediate reduction of BP in patients with hypertensive emergencies.\\nJudicious administration of these agents (\\nTable 3-5\\n) may also be appropriate in patients with hypertension complicated by HF or MI.\\nThese drugs are also indicated for individuals who have perioperative hypertensive urgency or are in need of emergency surgery. If\\npossible, an accurate baseline BP should be determined before the initiation of therapy. In the setting of hypertensive emergency, the\\npatient should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring, and an intra-arterial monitor should be used when\\navailable. Although parenteral agents are indicated as a first-line treatment in hypertensive emergencies, oral agents may also be\\neffective in this group; the choice of drug and route of administration must be individualized. If parenteral agents are used initially, oral\\nmedications should be administered shortly thereafter to facilitate rapid weaning from parenteral therapy.\\nSodium nitroprusside\\n, a direct-acting arterial and venous vasodilator, is the drug of choice for most hypertensive emergencies\\n(see \\nTable 3-5\\n). It reduces BP rapidly and is easily titratable, and its action is short lived when discontinued. Patients should be\\nmonitored very closely to avoid an exaggerated hypotensive response. Therapy for more than 48-72 hours with a high cumulative\\ndose or renal insufficiency may cause accumulation of thiocyanate, a toxic metabolite. Thiocyanate toxicity may cause\\nparesthesias, tinnitus, blurred vision, delirium, or seizures. Serum thiocyanate levels should be kept at <10 mg/dL. Patients on high\\ndoses (>2-3 mg/kg/min) or those with renal dysfunction should have serum levels of thiocyanate drawn after 48-72 hours of\\ntherapy. In patients with normal renal function or those receiving lower doses, levels can be drawn after 5-7 days. Hepatic\\ndysfunction may result in accumulation of cyanide, which can cause metabolic acidosis, dyspnea, vomiting, dizziness, ataxia, and\\nsyncope. Hemodialysis should be considered for thiocyanate poisoning. Nitrites and thiosulfate can be administered intravenously\\nfor cyanide poisoning.\\nNitroglycerin\\n given as a continuous IV infusion (see \\nTable 3-5\\n) may be appropriate in situations in which sodium nitroprusside is\\nrelatively contraindicated, such as in patients with severe coronary insufficiency or advanced renal or hepatic disease.

When given intravenously, the β-\\nadrenergic antagonist effect is greater than the α-adrenergic antagonist effect. Nevertheless, symptomatic postural hypotension\\nmay occur with IV use; thus, patients should be treated in a supine position. Labetalol may be particularly beneficial during\\nadrenergic excess (e.g., clonidine withdrawal, pheochromocytoma, post-coronary bypass grafting). Because the half-life of labetalol\\nis 5-8 hours, intermittent IV bolus dosing may be preferable to IV infusion. IV infusion can be discontinued before oral labetalol is\\nbegun. When the supine DBP begins to rise, oral dosing can be initiated at 200 mg PO, followed in 6-12 hours by 200-400 mg PO,\\ndepending on the BP response.\\nEsmolol\\n is a parenteral, short-acting, cardioselective β-adrenergic antagonist (see \\nTable 3-5\\n) that can be used in the treatment of\\nhypertensive emergencies in patients in whom β-blocker intolerance is a concern. Esmolol is also useful for the treatment of aortic\\ndissection. β-Adrenergic antagonists may be ineffective when used as monotherapy in the treatment of severe hypertension and\\nare frequently combined with other agents (e.g., with sodium nitroprusside in the treatment of aortic dissection).\\nNicardipine\\n is an effective IV calcium antagonist preparation (see \\nTable 3-5\\n) approved for use in postoperative hypertension. Side\\neffects include headache, flushing, reflex tachycardia, and venous irritation. Nicardipine should be administered via a central\\nvenous line. If it is given peripherally, the IV site should be changed q12h. Fifty percent of the peak effect is seen within the first 30\\nminutes, but the full peak effect is not achieved until after 48 hours of administration.\\nEnalaprilat\\n is the active de-esterified form of enalapril (see \\nTable 3-5\\n) that results from hepatic conversion after an oral dose.\\nEnalaprilat (as well as other ACE inhibitors) has been used effectively in cases of severe and malignant hypertension. However,\\nvariable and unpredictable results have also been reported. ACE inhibition can cause rapid BP reduction in hypertensive patients\\nwith high renin states such as renovascular hypertension, concomitant use of vasodilators, and scleroderma renal crisis; thus,\\nenalaprilat should be used cautiously to avoid precipitating hypotension. Therapy can be changed to an oral preparation when IV\\ntherapy is no longer necessary.\\nDiazoxide and hydralazine\\n are only rarely used in hypertensive crises and offer little or no advantage to the agents discussed\\npreviously. It should be noted, however, that hydralazine is a useful agent in pregnancy-related hypertensive emergencies because\\nof its established safety profile.\\nFenoldopam\\n is a selective agonist to peripheral dopamine-1 receptors, and it produces vasodilation, increases renal perfusion,\\nand enhances natriuresis. Fenoldopam has a short duration of action; the elimination half-life is <10 minutes. The drug has\\nimportant application as parenteral therapy for high-risk hypertensive surgical patients and the perioperative management of\\npatients undergoing organ transplantation.\\nOral loading of antihypertensive agents\\n has been used successfully in patients with hypertensive crisis when urgent but not\\nimmediate reduction of BP is indicated.\\nOral clonidine loading\\n is achieved by using an initial dose of 0.2 mg PO followed by 0.1 mg PO q1h to a total dose of 0.7 mg or a\\nreduction in diastolic pressure of 20 mm Hg or more. BP should be checked at 15-minute intervals over the first hour, 30-minute\\nintervals over the second hour, and then hourly. After 6 hours, a diuretic can be added, and an 8-hour clonidine dosing interval can\\nbe begun. Sedative side effects are significant.\\nSublingual nifedipine has an onset of action within 30 minutes but can produce wide fluctuations and excessive reductions in BP.\\nBecause of the potential for adverse cardiovascular events (stroke/MI), sublingual nifedipine should be avoided in the acute\\nmanagement of elevated BP. Side effects include facial flushing and postural hypotension.\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nHypertensive crisis.\\n In hypertensive emergency, control of acute or ongoing end-organ damage is more important than the absolute\\nlevel of BP. BP control with a rapidly acting parenteral agent should be accomplished as soon as possible (within 1 hour) to reduce\\nthe chance of permanent organ dysfunction and death. A reasonable goal is a 20-25% reduction of mean arterial pressure or a\\nreduction of the diastolic pressure to 100-110 mm Hg over a period of minutes to hours. A precipitous fall in BP may occur in patients\\nwho are elderly, volume depleted, or receiving other antihypertensive agents. BP control in hypertensive urgencies can be\\naccomplished more slowly. The initial goal of therapy in urgency should be to achieve a DBP of 100-110 mm Hg. Excessive or rapid'),\n",

Normal BP can be\\nattained gradually over several days as tolerated by the individual patient.\\nAortic dissection\\n Acute proximal aortic dissection (type A) is a surgical emergency, whereas uncomplicated distal dissection (type B)\\ncan be treated successfully with medical therapy alone. All patients, including those treated surgically, require acute and chronic\\nantihypertensive therapy to provide initial stabilization and to prevent complications (e.g., aortic rupture, continued dissection).\\nMedical therapy of chronic stable aortic dissection should seek to maintain SBP at or below 130-140 mm Hg if tolerated.\\nAntihypertensive agents with negative inotropic properties, including calcium channel antagonists, β-adrenergic antagonists,\\nmethyldopa, clonidine, and reserpine, are preferred for management in the postacute phase.\\nSodium nitroprusside\\n is considered the initial drug of choice because of the predictability of response and absence of\\ntachyphylaxis. The dose should be titrated to achieve an SBP of 100-120 mm Hg or the lowest possible BP that permits adequate\\norgan perfusion. Nitroprusside alone causes an increase in left ventricular contractility and subsequent arterial shearing forces,\\nwhich contribute to ongoing intimal dissection. Thus, when using sodium nitroprusside, adequate simultaneous \\nβ-adrenergic\\nantagonist therapy\\n is essential, regardless of whether systolic hypertension is present. Traditionally, propranolol has been\\nrecommended. \\nEsmolol\\n, a cardioselective class intravenous β-adrenergic antagonist with a very short duration of action, may be\\npreferable, especially in patients with relative contraindications to β-antagonists. If esmolol is tolerated, a longer acting β-adrenergic\\nantagonist should be used.\\nIV labetalol\\n has been used successfully as a single agent in the treatment of acute aortic dissection. Labetalol produces a dose-\\nrelated decrease in BP and lowers contractility. It has the advantage of allowing for oral administration after the acute stage of\\ndissection has been managed successfully.\\nThe elderly hypertensive patient\\n (age >60 years) is generally characterized by increased vascular resistance, decreased plasma\\nrenin activity, and greater LVH than in younger patients. Often, elderly hypertensive patients have coexisting medical problems that\\nmust be considered when initiating antihypertensive therapy. Drug doses should be increased slowly to avoid adverse effects and\\nhypotension. Diuretics as initial therapy have been shown to decrease the incidence of stroke, fatal MI, and overall mortality in this\\nage group (\\nJAMA 1991;265:3255\\n). Calcium channel antagonists decrease vascular resistance, have no adverse effects on lipid\\nlevels, and are also good choices for elderly patients. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be effective agents in this population.\\nAfrican American hypertensive patients\\n generally have a lower plasma renin level, higher plasma volume, and higher vascular\\nresistance than do Caucasian patients. Thus, African American patients respond well to diuretics, alone or in combination with\\ncalcium channel antagonists. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and β-adrenergic antagonists are also effective agents in this population,\\nparticularly when combined with a diuretic.\\nThe obese hypertensive patient\\n is characterized by more modest elevations in vascular resistance, higher cardiac output,\\nexpanded intravascular volume, and lower plasma renin activity at any given level of arterial pressure. Weight reduction is the\\nprimary goal of therapy and is effective in reducing BP and causing regression of LVH.\\nThe diabetic patient\\n with nephropathy may have significant proteinuria and renal insufficiency, which can complicate management\\n(see \\nChapter 13, Renal Diseases\\n). Control of BP is the most important intervention shown to slow loss of renal function. ACE\\ninhibitors should be used as first-line therapy, because they have been shown to decrease proteinuria and to slow progressive loss\\nof renal function independent of their antihypertensive effects. ACE inhibitors may also be beneficial in reducing the rates of death,\\nMI, and stroke in diabetics who have cardiovascular risk factors but lack left ventricular dysfunction. Hyperkalemia is a common\\nside effect in diabetic patients treated with ACE inhibitors, especially in those with moderate to severe impairment of their GFR.\\nARBs are also effective antihypertensive agents and have been shown to slow the rate of progression to ESRD, thus supporting a\\nrenal protective effect (\\n N Engl J Med 2001;345(12):861\\n).\\nThe patient with chronic renal insufficiency\\n has hypertension that usually is partially volume dependent. Retention of sodium\\nand water exacerbates the existing hypertensive state, and diuretics are important in the management of this problem. When\\nestimated GFR is <30-35 mL/min/1.73 m\\n2\\n, loop diuretics are the most effective class. In the presence of proteinuria, ACE\\ninhibitors/ARBs should be considered because higher urinary excretion of protein is associated with a more rapid decline in GFR,\\nregardless of the cause of renal insufficiency.\\nThe hypertensive patient with LVH\\n is at increased risk for sudden death, MI, and all-cause mortality. Although there is no direct\\nevidence, regression of LVH could be expected to reduce the risk for subsequent complications. ACE inhibitors appear to have the\\ngreatest effect on regression (\\nAm J Hypertens 1998;11(6 Pt 1):631\\n).\\nThe hypertensive patient with CAD\\n is at increased risk for UA and MI. β-Adrenergic antagonists can be used as first-line agents\\nin these patients because they can decrease cardiac mortality and subsequent reinfarction in the setting of acute MI and can\\ndecrease progression to MI in those who present with UA. β-Adrenergic antagonists also have a role in secondary prevention of\\ncardiac events and in increasing long-term survival after MI. Care should be exercised in those with cardiac conduction system\\ndisease. ACE inhibitors are beneficial in patients with CAD and decrease mortality in individuals who present with acute MI,\\nespecially those with left ventricular dysfunction (\\nEur Heart J 1999;20(2):136\\n; \\nN Engl J Med 1991;325(5):293\\n; \\nLancet\\n1995;345(8951):669\\n; \\nLancet 1994;343(8906):1115\\n).'),\n",

Elevated SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg on two occasions at least 4 hours apart or a one-time\\nmeasurement of SBP ≥160 mm Hg or DBP ≥110 mm Hg qualifies as hypertension. If no proteinuria is present, then hypertension\\nalong with one of the following qualifies: platelets <100,000/μL, creatinine >1.1 mg/dL (or doubling from baseline), liver\\ntransaminases greater than twice the normal, pulmonary edema, or cerebral/visual symptoms. Eclampsia encompasses these\\nparameters in addition to generalized seizures.\\nChronic (preexisting) hypertension.\\n This disorder is defined by a BP ≥140/90 mm Hg before the 20th week of pregnancy.\\nChronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia.\\n This classification is used when a woman with chronic hypertension\\ndevelops worsening hypertension and new proteinuria and/or other features of preeclampsia as outlined previously.\\nGestational hypertension.\\n This disorder is defined by a BP ≥140/90 mm Hg after the 20th week of pregnancy without proteinuria\\nor other features of preeclampsia.\\nTherapy.\\n Treatment of hypertension in pregnancy should begin if SBP is ≥160 mm Hg or DBP is ≥100 mm Hg.\\nNonpharmacologic therapy, such as weight reduction and vigorous exercise, is not recommended during pregnancy.\\nAlcohol and tobacco use should be strongly discouraged.\\nPharmacologic intervention with labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa is recommended as first-line therapy because of its proven\\nsafety. Other antihypertensives have theoretical disadvantages, but none except the ACE inhibitors have been proven to increase\\nfetal morbidity or mortality.\\nIf a patient is suspected of having preeclampsia or eclampsia, urgent referral to an obstetrician who specializes in high-risk\\npregnancy is recommended.\\nMAOIs.\\n MAOIs used in association with certain drugs or foods can produce a catecholamine excess state and accelerated\\nhypertension. Interactions are common with tricyclic antidepressants, meperidine, methyldopa, levodopa, sympathomimetic agents,\\nand antihistamines. Tyramine-containing foods that can lead to this syndrome include certain cheeses, red wine, beer, chocolate,\\nchicken liver, processed meat, herring, broad beans, canned figs, and yeast. Nitroprusside, labetalol, and phentolamine have been\\nused effectively in the treatment of accelerated hypertension associated with MAOI use (see \\nTable 3-5\\n).\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nWithdrawal syndrome associated with discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy.\\n In substituting therapy in patients with\\nmoderate-to-severe hypertension, it is reasonable to increase doses of the new medication in small increments while tapering the\\nprevious medication to avoid excessive BP fluctuations. On occasion, an AWS develops, usually within the first 24-72 hours.\\nOccasionally, BP rises to levels that are much higher than those of baseline values. The most severe complications of AWS include\\nencephalopathy, stroke, MI, and sudden death. AWS is associated most commonly with centrally acting adrenergic agents (particularly\\nclonidine) and β-adrenergic antagonists but has been reported with other agents as well, including diuretics. Discontinuation of\\nantihypertensive medications should be done with caution in patients with preexisting cerebrovascular or\\ncardiac disease. Management of AWS by reinstitution of the previously administered drug is generally effective.\\nMONITORING/FOLLOW-UP\\nBP measurements should be performed on multiple occasions under nonstressful circumstances (e.g., rest, sitting, empty bladder,\\ncomfortable temperature) to obtain an accurate assessment of BP in a given patient.'),\n",

Alternatively, it may also be due to progressive\\nmechanical obstruction from advancing atherosclerotic disease, in-stent restenosis, or bypass graft\\ndisease.\\nPlaque rupture may be triggered by local and/or systemic inflammation as well as shear stress. Rupture\\nallows exposure of lipid-rich subendothelial components to circulating platelets and inflammatory cells,\\nserving as a potent substrate for thrombus formation. A thin fibrous cap (thin-cap fibroatheroma) is felt to\\nbe more vulnerable to rupture and is most frequently represented as only moderate stenosis on\\nangiography.\\nLess common causes include dynamic obstruction of the coronary artery due to vasospasm (Prinzmetal\\nangina, cocaine), coronary artery dissection (more common in women), coronary vasculitis, and embolus.'),\n",

LaRue\\nJustin M. Vader\\nHEART FAILURE\\nGeneral Principles\\nDEFINITION\\nHeart failure (HF) is a \\nclinical syndrome\\n in which either structural or functional abnormalities of the heart\\nimpair its ability to fill with or eject blood, resulting in dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention (\\nCirculation\\n2013;128:e240-e327\\n). HF is a progressive disorder and is associated with extremely high morbidity and\\nmortality.\\nCLASSIFICATION\\nHF may be due to abnormalities in myocardial contraction (systolic dysfunction), relaxation and filling (diastolic\\ndysfunction), or both.\\nLeft ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is used to subdivide HF patients into groups for therapeutic and\\nprognostic purposes. These groups are:\\nEF <40%: HF with reduced EF (HFrEF)\\nEF 40-50%: HF with borderline EF\\nEF >50%: HF with preserved EF (HFpEF)\\nHF is classified in terms of natural history by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association\\n(ACC/AHA) HF stage and in terms of symptom status by New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class\\n(\\nTables 5-1\\n and \\n5-2\\n).\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nIn the United States, over 5.7 million people are living with HF (\\nCirculation 2014;131: e29-e322\\n).\\nApproximately 870,000 new cases of HF are diagnosed each year.\\nHF accounts for over 1 million hospitalizations per year.\\nEstimated 1- and 5-year mortality are 30% and 50%, respectively (\\nCirculation 2010;123(4): 410-528\\n).\\nETIOLOGY\\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most frequent cause of HF in the United States. Other risk factors with\\nhigh population attributable risk include tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity (\\nCirculation\\n2014;131:e29-e322\\n).\\nOther causes include valvular heart disease, toxin induced (alcohol, cocaine, chemotherapy), myocarditis\\n(infectious or autoimmune), familial cardiomyopathy, infiltrative disease (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis,\\nhemochromatosis), peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), constrictive'),\n",

A serum BNP >400 pg/mL is consistent with HF;\\nhowever, specificity is reduced in patients with renal dysfunction. A serum BNP level <100 pg/mL has a\\ngood negative predictive value to exclude HF in patients presenting with dyspnea (\\nCurr Opin Cardiol\\n2006;21:208\\n).

A reentrant mechanism can occur when differential refractory\\nperiods and conduction velocities allow for propagation of an activation wavefront in a unidirectional manner around a zone of scar or refractory cardiac tissue. Reentry\\nof the activation wavefront around a myocardial circuit sustains the arrhythmia (e.g., VT).\\nDisorders of impulse formation: Enhanced automaticity\\n (e.g., accelerated junctional and accelerated idioventricular rhythm) \\nand triggered activity\\n (e.g., long QT\\nsyndrome and digitalis toxicity) are other less common mechanisms of tachyarrhythmias.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nTachyarrhythmias often produce symptoms that lead to patient presentation at an outpatient or acute care setting.\\nThey can be associated with systemic illnesses in patients who are being evaluated in the emergency department or are being treated in an inpatient setting.\\nHistory\\nSymptoms generally guide clinical decision making.\\nDyspnea, angina, lightheadedness or syncope, and decreased level of consciousness\\n are severe symptoms that mandate urgent treatment.\\nBaseline symptoms that reflect \\npoor left ventricular (LV) function\\n, such as dyspnea on exertion (DOE), orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), and\\nlower extremity swelling, are critical to elucidate.\\nPalpitations:\\n Common symptom of tachyarrhythmias.

To enhance diagnostic value of rhythm strip, use leads V\\n1\\n and II (atrial\\nactivity).\\nDefinition\\nAF is an atrial tachyarrhythmia characterized by chaotic activation of the atria with loss of atrial mechanical function. AF has a pattern on 12-lead ECG characterized\\nby the absence of consistent P waves. Instead, rapid, low-amplitude oscillations or fibrillatory waves are noted in the baseline of leads that best demonstrate atrial\\nactivation (V\\n1\\n, II, III, aVF). The ventricular response to AF is characteristically irregular and often rapid in the presence of intact AV conduction. AF is the most\\ncommon cardiac arrhythmia.\\nClassification\\nAF has been classified into four forms based on the clinical presentation: first occurrence, paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent forms.\\nFirst occurrence\\n may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. The spontaneous conversion rate is high, measured >60% in hospitalized patients.\\nParoxysmal\\n AF describes a recurrent form of AF in which individual episodes are <7 days and usually <48 hours in duration.\\nPersistent\\n AF describes a recurrent form of AF in which individual episodes are >7 days in duration or require electrical cardioversion to terminate.\\nLongstanding persistent\\n AF describes the form of AF that has failed attempts at cardioversion, electrical or pharmacologic, or has been accepted due to\\ncontraindications for cardioversion or a lack of symptoms.\\nEpidemiology\\nAF is the most common sustained tachyarrhythmia for which patients seek treatment and the most likely etiology for an irregularly irregular rhythm discovered on an\\ninpatient ECG. AF is typically a disease of the elderly, affecting >10% of those >75 years old.\\nIndependent risk factors for AF, in addition to advanced age, include male sex, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease such as CHF, valvular heart disease,\\nhypertension (HTN), and previous MI (\\nJAMA 1994;271:840\\n). Below age 65, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea are important risk factors for new-onset AF (\\nJ Am Coll\\nCardiol 2007;49(5):565\\n). Although clinical hyperthyroidism is associated with new-onset AF, the prevalence is low in a population of patients with AF (\\nJ Epidemiol\\n2008;18(5):209\\n).\\nFollowing cardiothoracic surgery, AF occurs in 20-50% of patients (\\nJ Am Coll Cardiol 2006;48(4):8540\\n).\\nPathophysiology\\nThe precise mechanisms giving rise to AF are incompletely understood. The initiation of AF is commonly due to rapid, repetitive firing of an ectopic focus within the\\npulmonary veins with fibrillatory conduction to the bodies of the atria. The maintenance of persistent AF likely requires multiple reentrant circuits varying in location\\nand timing to explain the self-perpetuating characteristic of AF. Structural and electrical remodeling of the left atrium associated with cardiovascular disease promotes\\nectopic activity and heterogeneous conduction patterns that provide the substrate for AF. AF, when present, also promotes structural and electrical remodeling in the\\natria that stabilizes the rhythm. Inflammation and fibrosis may play a major role in initiation and maintenance of AF. Inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and\\nC-reactive protein, are raised in AF and correlate with the duration of AF, success of cardioversion, and thrombogenesis.'),\n",

Some analyses suggest that statins may reduce recurrent AF by 61%, independent of their lipid-lowering effect (\\nJ Am Coll\\nCardiol 2008;51:828\\n). Angiotensin-converting\\nenzyme \\n(ACE)\\n inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers \\n(ARBs)\\n have been shown to prevent atrial remodeling in animals via suppression of the renin-\\nangiotensin system. A meta-analysis of patients with CHF and HTN treated with either ACEIs or ARBs demonstrated a reduction in new-onset AF by 20-30% (\\nJ\\nAm Coll Cardiol 2005;45:1832\\n).\\nA number of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies have been evaluated to prevent postoperative AF. Perioperative continuation of \\nβ-adrenergic\\nantagonists\\n has been shown to reduce postoperative AF rates. \\nAmiodarone, sotalol, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids\\n used in the perioperative period\\nhave demonstrated a reduction in postoperative AF (\\nAnn Pharmacother 2007;41:587\\n).\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nAF is diagnosed by 12-lead ECG with a stereotypical pattern of an irregularly fluctuating baseline with an irregular, and often rapid, ventricular rate (>100 bpm). AF\\nshould be distinguished from other tachycardia mechanisms with an irregular ventricular response such as MAT and AFl with variable conduction.\\nClinical Presentation\\nSymptoms associated with AF can range from severe (acute pulmonary edema, palpitations, angina, syncope) to nonspecific (fatigue) to none at all. Symptoms are\\nusually secondary to the rapid ventricular response to AF rather than the loss of atrial systole. However, patients with significant ventricular systolic or diastolic\\ndysfunction can have symptoms directly attributable to the loss of atrial systole. Prolonged episodes of tachycardia due to AF may lead to a \\ntachycardia-induced\\ncardiomyopathy\\n.\\nTREATMENT\\nThe medical management of AF is directed at three therapeutic goals: \\nrate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control\\n through\\nmaintenance of sinus rhythm. Previous studies have shown that there is no mortality advantage to a management strategy aimed at maintaining sinus rhythm (\\nN Engl\\nJ Med 2002;347:1825\\n). Therefore, rate control and management of thromboembolic risk are the preferred strategy in minimally symptomatic patients. Rhythm control\\nis reserved for patients who remain symptomatic despite reasonable efforts at pharmacologic rate control.\\nMedications\\nMedical management begins with consideration of appropriate antithrombotic therapy. Warfarin has been shown to be consistently superior to aspirin (ASA) or ASA\\nin combination with clopidogrel for prevention of thromboembolus. The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban have\\nbeen directly compared to warfarin in randomized prospective trials that documented a lower rate of stroke and systemic emboli compared to warfarin. Rate control of\\nthe ventricular response to AF is achieved with medications that limit conduction through the AV node such as \\nverapamil, diltiazem, β-adrenergic antagonists,\\nand digoxin\\n. Rhythm control through maintenance of sinus rhythm can be attempted with selected antiarrhythmic drugs. Pharmacologic control with antiarrhythmic\\ndrugs is most effective at preventing recurrence of AF and less effective at chemical cardioversion of AF (\\nTable 7-3\\n).\\nFirst Line\\nPrevention of stroke and systemic emboli\\n is a central tenet of AF management guided by individual risk assessment in each patient. Systemic anticoagulation\\nwith warfarin or an NOAC will attenuate the risk of stroke or systemic emboli associated with AF; however, the use of any one of these agents requires a careful\\nrisk-benefit analysis to identify\\npatients who are at sufficient risk for thromboembolic events to outweigh the increased risk of hemorrhagic complications.\\nTABLE 7-3 Pharmacologic Agents Used for Heart Rate Control in Atrial Fibrillation\\nDrug\\nLoading Dose\\nOnset\\nof\\nAction\\nMaintenance Dose\\nMajor Side Effects\\nRecommendation\\nWithout evidence of accessory pathway\\nEsmolol\\na\\nIV: 0.5 mg/kg over 1 min\\n5\\nmin\\nb\\n0.06-0.2 mg/kg/min\\n↓BP, ↓HR, HB, HF, bronchospasm\\nI\\nMetoprolol\\na\\nIV: 2.5-5.0 mg bolus\\nover 2 min (up to three\\ndoses)\\nPO: Same as\\nmaintenance\\n5 min\\nNA\\n25-100 mg bid\\n↓BP, ↓HR, HB, HF, bronchospasm\\nI\\nPropranolol\\na\\nIV: 0.15 mg/kg\\n4-6 h\\n5 min\\nNA\\n↓BP, ↓HR, HB, HF, bronchospasm\\nI\\nPO: Same as\\n60-90\\n80-240 mg/d in'),\n",

Ibutilide is associated with a 4-8% risk for torsades de pointes (TdP),\\nespecially in the first 2-4 hours after administration of the drug. Because of this risk, patients must be monitored on telemetry with an external defibrillator\\nimmediately available during ibutilide infusion and for at least 4 hours after the infusion. The risk for TdP is higher in patients with cardiomyopathy and CHF.\\nIbutilide is given via an IV, at a dosage of 1 mg (0.01 mg/kg if patient is <60 kg), \\ninfused slowly over 10 minutes\\n. Faster administration can promote TdP. The\\nefficacy of antiarrhythmics to achieve pharmacologic conversion drops sharply when AF is >7 days in duration. For shorter duration AF episodes, dofetilide,\\nsotalol, flecainide, and propafenone have some efficacy, whereas amiodarone has limited efficacy to achieve pharmacologic cardioversion.\\nMaintenance of sinus rhythm\\n with antiarrhythmic agents is associated with a small risk for life-threatening proarrhythmia. As a result, antiarrhythmic therapy\\nshould be reserved for patients who have highly symptomatic AF despite adequate rate control. Commonly used antiarrhythmic agents, their major route of\\nelimination, and dosing regimens are listed in \\nTable 7-5\\n. The most effective agents for maintenance of sinus rhythm are flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, dofetilide,\\namiodarone, and dronedarone.\\nFlecainide\\n and \\npropafenone\\n can be considered for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with \\nstructurally normal hearts\\n. In patients with structural heart\\ndisease, these agents are associated with an increased mortality rate (\\nN Engl J Med 1989;321:406\\n), and both agents are potent negative inotropes that can\\nprovoke or exacerbate heart failure. Both agents prolong the QRS duration as an early manifestation of toxicity. Toxicity increases with heart rate due to\\npreferential blockade of active sodium channels. This property is described as \\npositive use dependence\\n. Exercise ECG can be used to give additional\\ninformation about dose safety at higher heart rates. Flecainide should be used with caution without concomitant dosing with an AV nodal blocker because a\\nparadoxical increase in the ventricular rate may occur due to drug-induced conversion of AF to AFl. Propafenone is less prone to this phenomenon due to\\nintrinsic β-adrenergic antagonism.\\nSotalol\\n is useful for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. Sotalol is a mixture of stereoisomers (DL-); D-sotalol is a potassium channel blocker, whereas L-sotalol is\\na β-antagonist.\\nSide effects reflect both mechanisms of action. In addition to QT interval prolongation leading to TdP, DL-sotalol may result in sinus bradycardia or AV\\nconduction abnormalities. Sotalol should not be used in patients with decompensated CHF (due to the negative inotropic effect) or with a prolonged QT interval.'),\n",

Dofetilide is contraindicated in patients with a baseline corrected QT interval (QT\\nc\\n) >440 msec, or >500 msec in patients with bundle branch block. Initial\\ndosing of dofetilide is based on the creatinine clearance. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained before the first dose of dofetilide and 1-2 hours after each dose. If\\nthe QT\\nc\\n interval after the first dose is prolonged by 15% of the baseline or exceeds 500 msec, a 50% dosage reduction is indicated. If the QT\\nc\\n exceeds 500\\nmsec after the second dose, dofetilide must be discontinued. Several medications block the renal secretion of dofetilide (verapamil, cimetidine,\\nprochlorperazine, trimethoprim, megestrol, ketoconazole) and are contraindicated with dofetilide. The advantages of dofetilide are that it is not associated with\\nincreased CHF or mortality in patients with LV dysfunction (\\nN Engl J Med 1999;341:857\\n) and it does not cause sinus node dysfunction or conduction\\nabnormalities.\\nDronedarone\\n is the newest antiarrhythmic agent approved for treatment of AF. Like amiodarone, from which it was derived, dronedarone shares properties\\nwith Vaughan Williams classes I-IV antiarrhythmic drugs. Dronedarone has been shown to be more effective than placebo at maintaining sinus rhythm after\\ncardioversion but less effective than amiodarone at maintenance of sinus rhythm. The incidence of proarrhythmia is low with dronedarone, as is the incidence of\\norgan toxicity. A trend toward increased mortality has been shown in patients with advanced heart failure symptoms, and it is contraindicated in this patient\\ngroup. Dronedarone is metabolized in the liver and should not be used in patients with significant hepatic dysfunction. Dronedarone can be used in patients with\\nsignificant renal dysfunction because clearance is predominantly in the feces.\\nAmiodarone\\n is arguably the most effective antiarrhythmic agent for maintenance of sinus rhythm. \\nBecause of the extensive toxicity profile of\\namiodarone, it should not be considered as a first-line agent for rhythm control of AF in patients in whom an alternative antiarrhythmic can be\\nsafely used.\\n IV amiodarone has a low efficacy for acute conversion of AF, although conversion after several days of IV amiodarone has been observed. Given\\nits common use and relatively high incidence of side effects, a more detailed discussion of these effects is required.\\nAdverse effects of oral amiodarone are partially dose dependent and may occur in up to 75% of patients treated at high doses for 5 years. At lower doses\\n(200-300 mg/d), adverse effects that require discontinuation occur in approximately 5-10% of patients per year.\\nPulmonary toxicity\\n occurs in 1-15% of treated patients but appears less likely in those who receive <300 mg/d (\\nCirculation 1990;82:580\\n). Patients\\ncharacteristically have a dry cough and dyspnea associated with pulmonary infiltrates and rales. The process appears to be reversible if detected early, but\\nundetected cases may result in a mortality rate of up to 10% of those affected. A CXR and pulmonary function tests should be obtained at baseline and every\\n12 months or when patients complain of shortness of breath. The presence of interstitial infiltrates on the chest radiograph and a decreased diffusing\\ncapacity raise concern of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.\\nPhotosensitivity\\n is a common adverse reaction, and in some patients, a violaceous skin discoloration develops in sun-exposed areas. The blue-gray\\ndiscoloration may not resolve completely with discontinuation of therapy.\\nThyroid dysfunction\\n is a common adverse effect. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported, with an incidence of 2-5% per year. Thyroid-\\nstimulating hormone should be obtained at baseline and monitored every 6 months. If hypothyroidism develops, concurrent treatment with levothyroxine may\\nallow continued amiodarone use.\\nCorneal microdeposits\\n, detectable on slit-lamp examination, develop in virtually all patients. These deposits rarely interfere with vision and are not an\\nindication for discontinuation of the drug. Optic neuritis, leading to blindness, is rare but has been reported in association with amiodarone.\\nThe most common \\nECG changes\\n are lengthened PR intervals and bradycardia; however, high-grade AV block may occur in patients who have preexisting\\nconduction abnormalities. Amiodarone may prolong QT intervals, although usually not extensively, and \\nTdP is rare\\n. Other agents that prolong the QT\\ninterval, however, should be avoided in patients who are taking amiodarone.\\nLiver dysfunction\\n usually manifests in an asymptomatic and transient rise in hepatic transaminases. If the increase exceeds three times normal or doubles\\nin a patient with an elevated baseline level, amiodarone should be discontinued or the dose should be reduced. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine\\ntransaminase (ALT) should be monitored every 6 months in patients who are receiving amiodarone.\\nDrug interactions.\\n Amiodarone may raise the blood levels of warfarin and digoxin; therefore, these drugs should be reduced routinely by one-half when\\namiodarone is started, and levels should be followed closely.\\nOther Nonpharmacologic Therapies\\nNonpharmacologic methods of rhythm control include catheter or surgical ablation techniques that block the initiation and maintenance of AF.\\nDirect current cardioversion (DCCV)\\n is the safest and most effective method of acutely restoring sinus rhythm. Prior to cardioversion, consideration of\\nthromboembolic risk and anticoagulation is critical, when possible, to minimize thromboembolic events triggered by the cardioversion process. AF with a rapid\\nventricular response in the setting of ongoing myocardial ischemia, MI, hypotension, or respiratory distress should receive prompt cardioversion regardless of the\\nanticoagulation status.\\nIf the duration of AF is documented to be \\n<48 hours\\n, cardioversion may proceed without anticoagulation. If AF has persisted for \\n>48 hours\\n (or for an unknown\\nduration), patients should be anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion, and anticoagulation should be continued in the same therapeutic range\\nfollowing successful cardioversion.\\nAn alternative to anticoagulation for 3 weeks before cardioversion is to perform a \\ntransesophageal echocardiogram\\n to rule out left atrial appendage thrombus\\nbefore cardioversion. This method is safe and has the advantage of a shorter time to cardioversion than 3 weeks of anticoagulation. Therapeutic\\nanticoagulation is indicated after the cardioversion for a minimum of 4 weeks (\\nAm J Cardiol 1998;82:1545\\n).\\nWhen practical, sedation should be accomplished with midazolam (1-2 mg IV q2min to a maximum of 5 mg), methohexital (25-75 mg IV), etomidate (0.2-0.6\\nmg/kg IV), or propofol (initial dose, 5 mg/kg/h IV).\\nProper synchronization of the DC shock to the QRS is critical to avoid induction of VT by a cardioversion shock delivered during a vulnerable period of the\\nventricle.\\nFor cardioversion of atrial arrhythmias, the anterior patch electrode should be positioned just right of the sternum at the level of the third or fourth intercostal\\nspace, with\\nthe second electrode positioned just below the left scapula posteriorly. \\nCare should be taken to position patch electrodes at least 6 cm from PPM or\\ndefibrillator generators.\\n If electrode paddles are used, firm pressure and conductive gel should be applied to minimize contact impedance. Direct contact with\\nthe patient or the bed should be avoided. Atropine (1 mg IV) should be readily available to treat prolonged pauses. Reports of serious arrhythmias, such as VT,\\nventricular fibrillation (VF), or asystole, are rare and are more likely in the setting of improperly synchronized cardioversions, digitalis toxicity, or concomitant\\nantiarrhythmic drug therapy.'),\n",

Cure\\nrates in this patient category are in the range of 70%. Cure rates are diminished in patients with structural heart disease, advanced age, and persistent AF. A\\nsignificant fraction of patients require more than one ablation procedure to achieve cure. The goal of the catheter ablation procedure in paroxysmal AF patients is\\nto achieve electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins. In patients with persistent AF, this goal is frequently combined with substrate modification strategies whereby\\nregions of the atria are targeted for ablation to block reentry or the presence of focal drivers of AF. Because of potential complications and modest success,\\npatients should undergo at least one trial of an antiarrhythmic drug for maintenance of sinus rhythm. If this trial is ineffective or poorly tolerated, curative catheter\\nablation can be contemplated.\\nSurgical Management\\nSurgical techniques for cure of AF have been evaluated since the 1980s. Of these techniques, the Cox-Maze procedure has the highest demonstrated efficacy and\\nthe most substantial published follow-up data documenting sustained efficacy. Including patients with persistent AF and structural heart disease, cure rates approach\\n90%. Because of its highly invasive nature, surgical treatment is usually reserved for patients who have failed a catheter ablation strategy or who have planned\\nconcomitant cardiac surgery.\\nVentricular Tachyarrhythmias\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nVentricular tachyarrhythmias should be initially approached with the assumption that they will have a malignant course until proven otherwise.\\nCharacterization of the arrhythmia involves consideration of hemodynamic stability, duration, morphology, and presence or lack of underlying structural heart disease.\\nUltimately, this characterization will aid in determining the patient's risk for \\nsudden cardiac arrest\\n and need for device or ablation-based therapy.\\nDefinitions\\nNonsustained VT:\\n Three or more consecutive ventricular complexes (>100 bpm) that terminate spontaneously within 30 seconds.\\nSustained monomorphic VT:\\n Tachycardia of ventricular origin with single QRS morphology that lasts longer than 30 seconds or requires cardioversion due to\\nhemodynamic compromise.\\nPolymorphic VT:\\n VT characterized by an ever-changing QRS morphology. \\nTdP\\n is a variant of polymorphic VT that is typically preceded by a prolonged QT\\ninterval in sinus rhythm. Polymorphic VT is associated with hemodynamic collapse or instability.\\nVF\\n is associated with disorganized mechanical contraction, hemodynamic collapse, and sudden death. The ECG reveals irregular and rapid oscillations (250-400\\nbpm) of highly variable amplitude without uniquely identifiable QRS complexes or T waves.\\nVentricular arrhythmias are the major cause of \\nsudden cardiac death (SCD)\\n. \\nSCD\\n is defined as death that occurs within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms. In the\\nUnited States, approximately 350,000 cases of SCD occur annually. Among patients with aborted SCD, ischemic heart disease is the most common associated\\ncardiac structural abnormality. Most cardiac arrest survivors do not have evidence of an acute MI; however, >75% have evidence of previous infarcts. A\\nnonischemic cardiomyopathy is also associated with an elevated risk for SCD.\\nEtiology\\nVT associated with structural heart disease\\nMost ventricular arrhythmias are associated with structural heart disease, typically related to active ischemia or history of infarct.\\nScar and the peri-infarct area provide the substrate for reentry that produces sustained monomorphic VT.\\nPolymorphic VT and VF are commonly associated with ischemia and are the presumed cause of most out-of-hospital SCDs.\\nNonischemic cardiomyopathy typically involves progressive dilation and fibrosis of the ventricular myocardium, providing an arrhythmogenic substrate.\\nInfiltrative cardiomyopathies (sarcoid, hemochromatosis, amyloid) represent a smaller patient population that is at significant risk for ventricular arrhythmias whose\\nmanagement is less clearly defined.\\nAdults with prior repair of congenital heart disease are commonly afflicted with both VT and SVT.\\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) dysplasia or cardiomyopathy is marked by fibrofatty replacement of the RV (and sometimes LV) myocardium that gives rise to\\nleft bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology VT and is associated with sudden death, particularly in young athletes.\\nBundle branch reentry VT is a form of VT that uses the His-Purkinje system in a reentrant circuit and is typically associated with cardiomyopathy and an abnormal\\nconduction system.\\nVT in the absence of structural heart disease\\nInherited ion channelopathies, such as those seen in Brugada and long QT syndromes, can lead to polymorphic VT and sudden death in patients without evidence\\nof structural heart disease on imaging.\\nCatecholaminergic polymorphic VT involves familial, exercise-induced VT that is related to irregular calcium processing.\\nIdiopathic VT\\n is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires the documented absence of structural heart disease, genetic disorders, and reversible etiologies (i.e.,\\nischemia, electrolyte/metabolic abnormalities). Most idiopathic VTs originate from the RV outflow tract (RVOT) and are amenable to ablation. Less commonly, LV\\noutflow tract (LVOT) VT or fascicular VT (using anterior and posterior divisions of the left bundle branch) may be discovered on EPS.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nThe evaluation of wide-complex tachyarrhythmias (WCTs) should always begin with prompt assessment of vital signs and clinical symptoms. If the arrhythmia is\\npoorly tolerated, postpone further detailed evaluation and proceed to acute management per ACLS guidelines. If stable, there are several important questions to\\naddress that can guide one toward the most likely diagnosis. A common mistake is the assumption that hemodynamic stability supports the diagnosis of SVT over\"),\n",

With that in mind, one can then proceed to elicit\\nseveral historical points of emphasis and scrutinize ECG properties of the arrhythmia to further delineate the mechanism of the underlying rhythm disturbance.\\nBegin with the following questions:\\nDoes the patient have a history of structural heart disease? Patients with structural heart disease are much more likely to have VT rather than SVT as the\\netiology of a WCT. In one report, 98% of patients with WCT who had prior MI proved to have VT (\\nAm J Med 1988;84:53\\n).\\nDoes the patient have a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or wide QRS at baseline?\\nThe presence of either a pacemaker or an ICD should raise suspicion for a device-mediated WCT.\\nDevice-mediated WCT\\n can be due to ventricular pacing at a rapid rate either due to device tracking of an atrial tachyarrhythmia or an “endless loop\\ntachycardia” created by tracking of the retrograde atrial impulses created by the preceding ventricular paced beat. In either case, the tachycardia rate is a\\nclue to the mechanism because this is typically equal to the programmed upper rate limit (URL) of the device. A commonly programmed URL is 120 paces per\\nminute (ppm). A tachycardia rate above the URL effectively excludes a device-mediated WCT.\\nDevice can be confirmed by inspection of the chest wall (usually left chest for righthanded patients), chest radiograph (CXR), or the presence of pacing\\nspikes seen on ECG.\\nPatients with known right bundle branch block (RBBB), LBBB, or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) at baseline who present with WCT will have a QRS\\nmorphology identical to baseline in the presence of SVT. In addition, some patients with a narrow QRS at baseline will manifest a WCT due to SVT when a\\nrate-related bundle branch block is present (SVT with aberrancy).\\nWhat medications is the patient taking?\\nThe medication list should be scanned for any medication with proarrhythmic side effects, especially those that can prolong the baseline QT interval. These\\nmedicines include many of the class I and III antiarrhythmics, certain antibiotics, antipsychotics, and many more.\\nMedications that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities, such as loop and potassiumsparing diuretics, ACEIs, ARBs, etc., should be ascertained. Also, digoxin\\ntoxicity is always an important consideration in the setting of any arrhythmia.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nWCT may be due to either SVT with aberrant conduction or VT. Differentiation between these mechanisms is of the utmost importance. \\nThe pharmacologic\\nagents used in the management of SVT (i.e., adenosine,\\n β\\n-blockers, calcium channel blockers) can cause hemodynamic instability if used in\\nthe setting of VT.\\n Therefore, all WCTs are considered to be ventricular in origin until proven otherwise.\\nOther less common mechanisms of WCT include \\nantidromic AVRT, hyperkalemiainduced arrhythmia, or pacemaker-induced tachycardia\\n.\\nTelemetry artifact\\n due to poor lead contact or repetitive patient motion (tremor, shivering, brushing teeth, chest physical therapy, etc.) can mimic VT or VF.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nLaboratories\\nLaboratory studies should include basic metabolic panel, magnesium, CBC, and serial troponins.\\nElectrocardiography\\nDifferentiation of SVT with aberrancy from VT\\n based on ECG analysis is critical in the determination of appropriate acute and chronic therapy. Features that\\nare diagnostic of VT are \\nAV dissociation\\n, \\ncapture or fusion beats\\n, an absence of RS morphology in the precordial leads (V\\n1\\n-V\\n6\\n), and \\nLBBB morphology with\\nright axis deviation\\n. In the absence of these features, examination of an RS complex in a precordial lead for an RS interval >100 msec is consistent with VT. In\\naddition, characteristic QRS morphologies that are suggestive of VT may be sought, as shown in \\nFigure 7-2\\n.\\nECG pearls\\nClassic Brugada pattern\\nBaseline: Pseudo-RBBB with ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in V\\n1\\n, V\\n2\\nMay be unmasked by stress, illness, fever, illicit drug use, etc.\\nArrhythmogenic RV dysplasia\\nBaseline: Epsilon wave (late potential just after QRS), ± wide QRS, ± T-wave inversion (V\\n1\\n, V\\n2\\n)\\nVT: Reflects RV origin, likely LBBB configuration; may present with polymorphic VT\\nBundle branch reentrant VT\\nBaseline: IVCD\\nVT: LBBB morphology typically (“down” the right bundle; “up” the left bundle)\\nFascicular VT\\nVT: Superior axis, RBBB morphology\\nLong QT syndrome\\nBaseline: QT >50% of the RR interval if HR 60-100 bpm; QT\\nc\\n ≥440 msec\\nVT: TdP degenerating into VF\\nOutflow tract VT\\nVT: Inferior axis, LBBB morphology.

The superiority of ICD\\ntherapy to chronic antiarrhythmic drug therapy has been demonstrated (AVID trial; \\nN Engl J Med 1997;337:1576\\n).\\nPrimary prevention of SCD\\n with ICD implantation is indicated for patients who are at high risk of SCD. The efficacy of ICD implantation for primary prevention\\nof SCD in the setting of cardiomyopathy has been established in multiple prospective clinical trials (see Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial\\n[MADIT]\\n, \\nN Engl J Med 1996;335:1933\\n; Multicenter Un-Sustained Tachycardia Trial \\n[MUSTT]\\n, \\nN Engl J Med 1999;341:1882\\n; \\nMADIT II Trial\\n, \\nN Engl J Med\\n2002;346:877\\n; and \\nSCD-HeFT\\n, \\nN Engl J Med 2005;352(3):225\\n). Most patients with an LV ejection fraction of <35% for more than 3 months on optimal medical\\ntherapy meet current indications for prophylactic ICD implantation.\\nOther indications for ICD\\nPhenotypes associated with \\nHCM, arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, congenital long QT syndrome, or Brugada syndrome have a higher risk of\\nSCD\\n. ICD implantation is indicated if patients with one of these syndromes have had a resuscitated cardiac arrest or documented ventricular arrhythmia.\\nProphylactic ICD implantation is based on disease-specific risk factors.\\nPatients who are awaiting cardiac transplantation are at high risk for SCD, especially if they are receiving an intravenous inotrope. Prophylactic ICD\\nimplantation is reasonable to protect against SCD prior to transplantation.\\nICDs are \\ncontraindicated\\n in patients who have incessant VT, recent MI <40 days or revascularization <3 months in the case of primary prevention,\\nsignificant psychiatric illnesses, or life expectancy of <12-24 months.\\nRadiofrequency catheter ablation of VT\\n is most successfully performed in patients with hemodynamically stable forms of idiopathic VT that is not associated\\nwith structural heart disease. Long-term cure rates in these patients are similar to those achieved for catheter ablation of SVT. In the presence of structural heart\\ndisease, catheter ablation has a lower efficacy and a higher morbidity but is an important treatment option, particularly in drug-refractory, symptomatic VT that is\\nleading to ICD therapy.\\nIdiopathic VT is usually associated with a structurally normal heart, but an associated tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy has been described.\\nOutflow tract VT\\n often presents as repetitive, nonsustained bursts of VT that originates most commonly from the RV (RVOT) and less commonly from the LV\\nnear the coronary cusps or aorto-mitral continuity. These can be responsive to β-adrenergic blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, and adenosine.\\nBoth forms of idiopathic VT are thought to be benign in the absence of structural heart disease. Therefore, ICD implantation is not appropriate. All forms of\\nidiopathic VT are amenable to treatment with RFA or drug therapy.\\nVT associated with ischemic heart disease\\n can also be treated by catheter ablation by targeting the scar-based substrate. Emergent catheter ablation in the\\nsetting of frequent hemodynamically unstable VT requiring defibrillation (VT storm) can be life-saving. Ablation has been shown to be reduce ICD therapy and\\nimprove quality of life.\\nAblation of VT in nonischemic cardiomyopathy\\n is also reasonable, particularly in drug-refractory patients, but VT circuits may be intramyocardial or\\nepicardial. As a result, success rates are typically lower than those associated with ischemic VT, and referral to a center that routinely performs both\\nendocardial and epicardial ablations should be considered.\\nMedications\\nVF that is resistant to external defibrillation requires the addition of IV antiarrhythmic agents.\\nIV lidocaine is frequently used; however, IV amiodarone appears to be more effective in increasing survival of VF when used in conjunction with defibrillation (\\nN\\nEngl J Med 2002;346:884\\n).\\nAfter successful defibrillation, continuous IV infusion of effective antiarrhythmic therapy should be maintained until any reversible causes have been corrected.'),\n",

In the setting of hemodynamically unstable\\nventricular arrhythmias treated with an ICD, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is often necessary to prevent frequent device discharges.\\nFirst Line\\nAmiodarone\\n is safe and well tolerated for the acute management of ventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone has complex pharmacokinetics and is associated with\\nsignificant toxicities arising from chronic therapy (\\nAm Heart J 1993;125:109\\n).\\nAfter oral loading, amiodarone prevents the recurrence of sustained VT or VF in up to 60% of patients. A therapeutic latency of more than 5 days exists before\\nbeneficial antiarrhythmic effects are observed with oral dosing, and full suppression of arrhythmias may\\nnot occur for 4-6 weeks after therapy is initiated. Unfortunately, recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias during long-term follow-up is common.\\nClass II\\n agents, the β-adrenergic antagonists, are the only class of antiarrhythmic agents to have consistently shown improved survival in post-MI patients.\\nβ-Adrenergic blockers reduce postinfarction total mortality by 25-40% and SCD by 32-50% (\\nLancet 1981;2:823\\n; \\nLancet 1999;353:9\\n; \\nLancet 1999;353:2001\\n; \\nN\\nEngl J Med 2001;344:1651\\n; \\nLancet 2001;357:1385\\n).\\nAfter acute therapy of VT/VF and stabilization, β-adrenergic blockers should be initiated and titrated as blood pressure and heart rate allow.\\nACEIs\\n have also been shown to reduce sudden death and overall mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or CHF.\\nSecond Line\\nSotalol\\n is a \\nclass III\\n agent indicated for the chronic treatment of VT/VF. Sotalol prevents the recurrence of sustained VT and VF in 70% of patients (\\nN Engl J Med\\n1993;329:452\\n) but must be used with caution in individuals with CHF.\\nClass I\\n agents in general have not been shown to reduce mortality in patients with VT/VF. In fact, the class Ic agents, \\nflecainide\\n and \\npropafenone\\n, are\\nassociated with increased mortality in patients with ventricular arrhythmias after MI (\\nN Engl J Med 1991;324:781\\n).\\nLidocaine\\n is a \\nclass Ib\\n agent available only in IV form with efficacy in the management of sustained and recurrent VT/VF. The prophylactic use of lidocaine for\\nsuppression of premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained VT in the otherwise uncomplicated post-MI setting should be avoided. Toxicities of lidocaine\\ninclude central nervous system (CNS) effects (convulsions, confusion, stupor, and, rarely, respiratory arrest), all of which resolve with discontinuation of therapy.\\nSerum levels should be followed during prolonged use.\\nMexiletine\\n is similar to lidocaine but is available in oral form. \\nMexiletine is most often used in combination with either amiodarone or sotalol for chronic\\ntreatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias.\\n CNS toxicity includes tremor, dizziness, and blurred vision.

This should be distinguished from dissociation with competition at the AV node (“V > A” rates).\\nAdvanced or high-degree AV block\\n is present when more than one consecutive atrial depolarization fails to conduct to the ventricles (i.e., 3:1 block or\\ngreater). On ECG, consecutive P waves will be seen without associated QRS complexes. However, there will be demonstrable P:QRS conduction somewhere\\non the record to avoid a “third-degree” designation (\\nFigure 7-5\\n).\\nImaging\\nThe presence or absence of structural heart disease should be initially evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography.\\nFurther imaging should be obtained based on suspected etiology.\\nTREATMENT\\nPharmacologic Therapy\\nBradyarrhythmias that lead to significant symptoms and hemodynamic instability should be managed emergently as outlined in ACLS guidelines (see \\nAppendix C\\n).\\nFigure 7-5.\\n Examples of atrioventricular block (AVB). \\nA.\\n First-degree AVB.

Most patients have a combination of\\nboth components as the mechanism of their syncope.\\nSpecific stimuli may evoke a neurocardiogenic mechanism, leading to \\nsituational syncope\\n (e.g., micturition, defecation, coughing, swallowing).\\nRisk Factors\\nCardiovascular disease\\n, history of \\nstroke or TIA\\n, and \\nHTN\\n. Also, low body mass index, increased alcohol intake, and diabetes are associated with syncope (\\nAm J\\nCardiol 2000;85:1189\\n; \\nN Engl J Med 2002;347:878\\n).\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nA syncopal event may herald an otherwise unsuspected, potentially lethal cardiac condition, and therefore, a careful evaluation of the patient with syncope is\\nwarranted.\\nA meticulous history and physical exam are key to an accurate diagnosis of the etiology of syncope. In 40% of episodes, the mechanism of syncope remains\\nunexplained (\\nAnn Intern Med 1997;126:989\\n).\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nSpecial attention should be focused on the \\nevents or symptoms\\n that \\nprecede and follow\\n the syncopal event, \\neyewitness\\n accounts during the event, the \\ntime\\ncourse\\n of loss and resumption of consciousness (abrupt vs. gradual), and the patient's \\nmedical history\\n.\\nA characteristic prodrome of nausea, diaphoresis, visual changes, or flushing suggests neurocardiogenic syncope, as does the identification of a particular\\nemotional or situational trigger and postepisode fatigue.\\nAlternatively, an unusual sensory prodrome, incontinence, or a decreased level of consciousness that gradually clears suggests a seizure as a likely diagnosis.\\nWith transient ventricular arrhythmias, an abrupt loss of consciousness may occur with a rapid recovery.\\nSyncope with exertion is a matter of concern for structural heart disease, pulmonary HTN, and CAD.\\nPhysical Examination\\nThe \\ncardiovascular\\n and \\nneurologic\\n exams should be the primary focus of initial evaluation.\\nOrthostatic vital signs can reveal orthostatic hypotension.

If the patient is unresponsive, the head tilt-chin lift maneuver should be performed (see \\nAirway\\nEmergencies in Chapter 26, Medical Emergencies\\n). If neck immobilization is required, jaw thrust should be\\nperformed.\\nOral and nasopharyngeal airways:\\n Used when head and jaw positioning fail to establish a patent airway.\\nInitially inserted with the concave curve of the airway facing toward the roof of the mouth. The oral airway\\nthen is turned 180 degrees as it is inserted so that the concave curve of the airway follows the natural curve\\nof the tongue. Careful monitoring of airway patency is required, as malpositioning can push the tongue\\nposteriorly and result in oropharyngeal obstruction. Nasopharyngeal airways are made of soft plastic and\\nare passed easily down one of the nasal passages to the posterior pharynx after topical nasal lubrication\\nand anesthesia with viscous lidocaine jelly.\\nBag-valve-mask ventilation:\\n Ineffective respiratory efforts can be augmented with simple bag-valve-mask\\nventilation. Proper fitting and positioning of the mask using the “EC” hand position—thumb and index finger\\nforming a “C” around the mask, and the remaining fingers forming an “E” to support the jaw—ensure a tight\\nseal around the mouth and nose. Used in conjunction with proper positioning and airway adjuncts, e.g., oral\\nairway.\\nLaryngeal mask airway (LMA):\\n The LMA is a supraglottic airway device shaped like an endotracheal\\ntube connected to an elliptical mask. It is designed to be inserted over the tongue and seated in the\\nhypopharynx, covering the supraglottic structures and relatively isolating the trachea. It is a temporary\\nairway and should not be used for prolonged ventilatory support.\\nEndotracheal intubation\\n (\\nInt Anesthesiol Clin 2000;38:1\\n)\\nIndications:\\n Initiation of mechanical ventilation, airway protection, inadequate oxygenation with less\\ninvasive methods, prevention of aspiration, excessive pulmonary secretions, and hyperventilation as a\\ntreatment for increased intracranial pressure'),\n",

Aortic diameter is either\\nmeasured by the system or based on an internally programmed height nomogram.\\nOutput parameters: Blood velocity and flow time are measured and used to calculate stroke distance, stroke\\nvolume, and CO.\\nStroke distance: Area under the curve of flow-velocity waveform\\nStroke volume: Product of stroke distance and aortic cross-sectional area\\nCO: Product of stroke volume and heart rate\\nPulse pressure variation (ΔPp):\\n Requires arterial line placement.

Atkinson\\nJunfang Jiao\\nMario Castro\\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nDefinition\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a mostly preventable and treatable disorder\\ncharacterized by expiratory airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is often\\nprogressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or\\ngases, principally cigarette smoke (\\nGOLD Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention\\nof Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [Updated 2014]. Available at www.goldcopd.com\\n). \\nThe airflow\\nobstruction in COPD is caused by emphysema and airway disease.\\nEmphysema is defined pathologically as permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal\\nbronchiole accompanied by destruction of the alveolar walls and absence of associated fibrosis.\\nThe airway disease in COPD occurs principally in small airways (i.e., those with an internal diameter of\\n<2 mm). Chronic bronchitis is a common feature of COPD and is defined clinically as productive cough\\non most days for at least 3 consecutive months per year for at least 2 consecutive years, in the absence\\nof other lung disease that could account for this symptom. Individuals with chronic bronchitis but without\\nairflow obstruction do not have COPD.\\nEpidemiology\\nAlthough the prevalence of COPD is difficult to determine, it is estimated to affect 10-24 million Americans.\\nCOPD and other chronic lower respiratory diseases represent the third leading cause of death in the United\\nStates (\\nNatl Vital Stat Rep 2015;64(10):8\\n).\\nIn the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rate remains higher among Caucasians compared with African\\nAmericans, Hispanics, or Pacific Islanders, but rate differences between men and women have closed.\\nEtiology\\nMost cases of COPD are attributable to \\ncigarette smoking\\n. Although only a minority of cigarette smokers\\ndevelop clinically significant COPD, a much higher proportion develop abnormal lung function (\\nLancet\\n2011;378:991\\n).\\nEnvironmental (e.g., wood-burning stoves) and occupational dusts, fumes, gases, and chemicals\\n are\\nother etiologic agents of COPD. Household indoor air pollution is a major cause of fatal COPD in\\nunderdeveloped countries (\\nScience 2011;334:180\\n).\\nα\\n1\\n-Antitrypsin deficiency\\n is found in 1-2% of COPD patients. Clinical characteristics of affected patients\\nmay include a minimal smoking history, early-onset COPD (e.g., younger than 45 years of age), a family'),\n",

As a consequence, patients\\nhave paroxysms of cough, dyspnea, chest tightness, and wheezing.\\nAsthma is a chronic disease with episodic acute exacerbations that are interspersed with\\nsymptom-free periods.\\n Exacerbations are characterized by a progressive increase in\\nasthma symptoms that can last minutes to hours. They are associated with viral infections, allergens, and\\noccupational exposures, and occur when airway reactivity is increased and lung function becomes\\nunstable.\\nClassification\\nAsthma severity should be classified based on both level of impairment (symptoms, lung function, daily\\nactivities, and rescue medication use) and risk (exacerbations, lung function decline, and medication side\\neffects).\\nAt the initial evaluation, this assessment will determine the level of severity in patients not on controller\\nmedications (\\nTable 9-12\\n). The level of severity is based on the most severe category in which any feature\\nappears. On subsequent visits, or if the patient is on a controller medication, this assessment is based on the\\nlowest step of therapy to maintain clinical control (\\nTable 9-13\\n). Control of asthma is based on the most severe\\nimpairment or risk category.\\nDuring an exacerbation, the acute severity of the attack should be classified based on symptoms, signs, and\\nobjective measures of lung function (\\nTable 9-14\\n).\\nPatients who have had two or more exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids in the past year may be\\nconsidered in the same category as those who have persistent asthma, regardless of level of impairment.\\nEpidemiology\\nIn the United States:\\nAsthma is the leading chronic illness among children (20-30%) (\\nNCHS Data Brief 2012;1\\n).\\nThe prevalence of asthma and asthma-related mortality had been increasing from 1980 to the mid-1990s, but\\nsince the 2000s, a more gradual increase in prevalence and decrease in mortality have occurred.

History often reveals years of\\ngradually worsening symptoms, although a subset (acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic\\npneumonia) may present acutely.\\nCareful questioning should focus on exposures (pharmacologic agents, asbestos exposure, exposure to\\nindustrial fumes or dusts, bird antigens, and mold) as well as symptoms of connective tissue disease.\\nClinical features of common ILDs are described in Table 10-5.\\nPhysical Examination\\nFindings may include inspiratory crackles and digital clubbing. Close attention should be paid to\\nextrapulmonary findings that point toward connective tissue diseases. Examples include sclerodactyly,\\nmechanic's hands, Raynaud phenomenon, dry mucous membranes, and dermatologic findings such as\\ntelangiectasias, rash, or facial erythema.\\nDiagnostic Approach\\nImaging\\nPlain radiographs of the chest have variable appearance, with lung volume loss, interstitial thickening, and\\ncystic changes being most common in ILD.\\nIf initial radiograph or clinical scenario is consistent with ILD, the patient should be referred for high-\\nresolution CT (HRCT), which is the radiographic test of choice for patients with suspected ILD.\\nThe pattern of radiographic infiltrate is important in the differential diagnosis of ILD. Imaging patterns of\\ncommon ILDs are described in Table 10-5. Notably, published guidelines exist for the definitive radiologic\\ndiagnosis of certain ILDs, specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/UIP ( Am J Respir Crit Care Med\\n2011;183:788).\\nPulmonary Function Testing\\nSpirometry typically demonstrates a restrictive ventilatory defect characterized by a symmetric reduction in\\nforced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Definitive diagnosis of a\\nrestrictive ventilatory defect requires documentation of a reduction in total lung capacity to <80% predicted.\\nIn certain ILDs (e.g., sarcoidosis, LCH, HP), bronchiolar involvement may result in airflow obstruction,\\ncausing the FEV1 to decrease disproportionately to the FVC. In this circumstance, a mixed obstructive and\\nrestrictive defect may be seen. This circumstance may also exist in cases of comorbid emphysema.\\nDLCO is often significantly decreased in patients with ILD.\\nLaboratory Analysis\\nPatients with a diagnosis of ILD should be evaluated for evidence of a connective tissue disease as a\\npotential target for therapy. Some connective tissue diseases may manifest primarily with pulmonary\\nsymptoms. As an example, approximately 10-20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have lung\\ndisease as their initial clinical presentation (Proc Am Thorac Soc 2007;4(5):443).\\nANA and rheumatoid factor (RF) should be tested in most patients, even patients with UIP on thoracic\\nimaging.

They\\naccount for 10-15% of all ADRs.\\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions can be from a variety of mechanisms. They usually occur upon\\nreexposure to the offending drug.\\nPseudoallergic reactions, formerly called anaphylactoid reactions, are caused by IgE-independent\\ndegranulation of mast cells.\\nEpidemiology\\nFrom 1966-1996, 15.1% of hospitalized US patients experienced an ADR with an inci-dence of 3.1-6.2% of\\nhospital admissions due to ADRs (JAMA 1998;279:1200).\\nMortality from ADRs is significant and ranges from 0.14-0.32% (Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol\\n2005;5(4):309).\\nEtiology\\nβ-Lactam antibiotics are most commonly associated with immunologically mediated drug reactions.\\nAnaphylaxis has been reported to occur in 1:100,000, with serious allergic reactions in 4.6 per 10,000\\ndispenses (Drug Saf 2007;30(8):705).\\nHospitalized patients with a history of penicillin allergy have been shown to have a longer hospital stay with\\nincreased incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,\\nand Clostridium difficile infections compared to patients without a reported penicillin allergy (J Allergy Clin\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com\"),\n",

The major determinant of immunogenicity of\\npenicillin is the benzylpenicilloyl form seen in 93% of tissue-bound penicillin.\\nThe minor antigenic determinants are all remaining penicillin conjugates. They are comprised of\\nbenzylpenicillin, benzylpenicilloate, and benzylpenilloate.\\nMost immediate reactions to penicillins are related to the major determinant. In other penicillins such as\\nampicillin, the side chain is the antigenic determinant.\\nCross-reactivity of β-lactams.\\nThe cross-reactivity between β-lactam antibiotics is variable and largely determined by their side-chain\\nstructure attached to the β-lactam ring.\\nPrior to the 1980s, cephalosporins had a higher cross-reactivity to penicillin because they were\\ncontaminated with a small amount of penicillin (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;125(2 suppl 2):S126). Risk of\\na cross-reaction is 5.0-16.5% with first-generation cephalosporins, 4% with second-generation, and 1-3%\\nwith third- or fourth-generation (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117(2 suppl):S464).\\nAlthough many of the reactions to second- and third-generation cephalosporins are directed at the side\\nchains, skin testing to penicillin in these patients can be helpful because most severe anaphylactic\\nreactions are directed against the reactive bicyclic core.\\nPatients with a history of a severe reaction to penicillin should be considered sensitive to cephalosporin\\nunless they are skin test negative. Although patients with a history of a nonanaphylactic reaction to\\npenicillin can often be given a second- or third-generation cephalosporin safely, it is advisable to precede\\nthe dose with an oral provocation challenge.\\nSkin test cross-reactivity has been documented between carbapenems and penicillins. Patients undergoing\\na graded carbapenem challenge with a positive penicillin skin test and a negative carbapenem skin test did\\nnot have any hypersensitivity reactions (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;125(2 suppl 2):S126).\\nThe monobactam aztreonam rarely cross-reacts with penicillins.

TBW is distributed in two major compartments: two-thirds is intracellular fluid (ICF) and one-third is\\nextracellular fluid (ECF). ECF is further subdivided into intravascular and interstitial spaces in a ratio of 1:4.\\nExample: For a healthy 70-kg man,\\nTBW = 0.6 × 70 = 42 L\\nICF = 2/3 TBW = 0.66 × 42 = 28 L\\nECF = 1/3 TBW = 0.33 × 42 = 14 L\\nIntravascular compartment = 0.25 × 14 = 3.5 L\\nInterstitial compartment = 0.75 × 14 = 10.5 L\\nThe distribution of water between intravascular and interstitial spaces can also be affected by changes to\\nthe Starling balance of forces. Low oncotic pressure (i.e., low albumin states) and high hydrostatic pressure\\n(i.e., Na+-retentive states) increase the movement of fluid from vascular to interstitial compartments, which\\nis an important step in the development of edema.\\nBecause the majority of water is contained in the intracellular space, the loss of water alone (without Na+)\\ndoes not typically result in the hemodynamic changes associated with volume depletion. Instead,\\ndisturbances in TBW change serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations.\\nThe intact kidney adapts to changes in TBW by increasing water excretion or reabsorption. This is\\nmediated by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH; vasopressin), which permits water movement across the\\ndistal nephron. Although vasopressin release is predominately responsive to osmotic cues, volume\\ncontraction can cause a nonosmotic release of vasopressin, resulting in a reduction of renal water\\nexcretion.\\nTotal body Na+. 85-90% of total body Na+ is extracellular and constitutes the predominate solute in the ECF.\\nChanges to the body's total Na+ content typically results from a loss or gain of this Na+-rich fluid, leading to\\ncontraction or expansion of the ECF space. Clinically, this manifests as volume depletion (hypotension,\\ntachycardia) and volume expansion (peripheral or pulmonary edema).\\nNa+ concentration is distinct from Na+ content. Na+ concentration reflects the amount of Na+ distributed in a\\nfixed quantity of water. An increase in TBW can decrease the Na+ concentration even if the body's total Na+\\ncontent remains unchanged.\\nThe intact kidney can respond to altered Na+ content in the ECF space by increasing or decreasing Na+\\nreabsorption. This response is mediated by cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and central nervous system\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com\"),\n",

The result is an obligate urine output of at least 0.5 L/d.\\nThe water lost in stools is typically 200 mL/d.\\nInsensible water losses from the skin and respiratory tract amount to roughly 400-500 mL/d. The\\nvolume of water produced from endogenous metabolism (<250-350 mL/d) should be considered as well.\\nThe degree of insensible loss may vary tremendously depending on respiratory rate, metabolic state, and\\ntemperature (water losses increase by 100-150 mL/d for each degree of body temperature over 37°C).\\nFluid from drain losses must be factored in as well.\\nAfter adding each of these components, the minimum amount of water needed to maintain homeostasis is\\nroughly 1400 mL/d or 60 mL/h.\\nElectrolytes that are usually administered during maintenance fluid therapy are Na+ and K+ salts.\\nRequirements depend on minimum obligatory and ongoing losses.\\nIt is customary to provide 75-175 mEq Na+/d as NaCl.

The latter can be calculated as ([Urine Na+ × Serum Cr] ÷ [Urine Cr × Serum Na+]) × 100.\\nConcomitant metabolic alkalosis may increase urine Na+ excretion despite volume depletion due to\\nobligate excretion of Na+ to accompany the bicarbonate anion. In such cases, a urine chloride of <20\\nmEq is often helpful to confirm volume contraction.\\nUrine osmolality and serum bicarbonate levels may also be elevated.\\nHematocrit and serum albumin may be increased from hemoconcentration.\\nTREATMENT\\nIt is often difficult to estimate the volume deficit present, and thus, therapy is largely empiric, requiring\\nfrequent reassessments of volume status while resuscitation is under way.\\nMild volume contraction can usually be corrected via the oral route. However, the presence of\\nhemodynamic instability, symptomatic fluid loss, or intolerance to oral administration requires IV therapy.\\nThe primary therapeutic goal is to protect hemodynamic stability and replenish intravascular volume\\nwith fluid that will preferentially expand the ECF compartment. This can be accomplished with Na+-based\\nsolutions, because the Na+ will be retained in the ECF.\\nIsotonic fluid, such as NS (0.9% NaCl), contains a Na+ content similar to that of plasma fluid in the\\nECF and thus remains entirely in the ECF space. It is the initial fluid of choice for replenishing\\nintravascular volume.\\nThe administration of solute-free water is largely ineffective, because the majority of water will\\ndistribute to the ICF space.\\nHalf-normal saline (0.45% NS) has 77 mEq of Na+ per liter, roughly half the Na+ content of an equal\\nvolume in the ECF.

This can be averted with Na+-sensitive electrodes, and the normal ECF [Na+] can be confirmed with\\na normal serum osmolality.\\nHyperosmolar hyponatremia refers to circumstances in which an osmotically active solute other than Na+\\naccumulates in the ECF, drawing water into the ECF and\\ndiluting the Na+ content. This is most commonly caused by hyperglycemia, resulting in a fall in plasma\\n[Na+] of 1.6-2.4 mEq/L for every 100 mg/dL rise in plasma glucose (Am J Med 1999;106:399).

This is seen in psychogenic polydipsia, water intoxication from\\npoorly conceived drinking games, beer potomania, and the so-called “tea and toast” diet. Underlying each\\nof these circumstances is the fact that there is a limit to renal water clearance. Urine cannot be diluted to an\\nosmolality less than approximately 50 mOsm/L, meaning that a small amount of solute is required in even\\nthe most dilute urine. Ingestion of a high volume of water can thus exceed the capacity for excretion,\\nparticularly in those with a solute-poor diet, because the solute load required to generate urinary water loss\\nis quickly depleted. The excess water is retained, Na+ concentrations falls, and hyponatremia results.\\nDecreased clearance of water from the kidney can also occur through a variety of processes. As mentioned\\npreviously, renal water handling is largely controlled by ADH (or vasopressin). Nonosmotic stimulation of this\\nhormone occurs with volume contraction. Although this seems counterintuitive from an osmotic standpoint (it\\nfurther reduces renal water clearance and increases water retention), it is an “appropriate” adaptive response\\nto the threat of volume loss, tissue hypoperfusion, and impending hemodynamic collapse. Other conditions are\\ncharacterized by secretion of ADH, which is “inappropriate,” stimulated by neither osmotic nor volume-related\\nchanges.\\n“Appropriate” ADH secretion occurs with a fall in effective circulating volume. In these conditions, thirst and\\nwater retention are stimulated, protecting volume status at the cost of the osmolar status. This category is\\nclassically subdivided based on the associated assessment of ECF status.\\nHypovolemic hyponatremia may result from any cause of net Na+ loss, such as in thiazide use and\\ncerebral salt wasting.\\nHypervolemic hyponatremia occurs in edematous states such as congestive heart failure (CHF), hepatic\\ncirrhosis, and severe nephrotic syndrome. Despite the expanded interstitial space, the circulating volume is\\nreduced. Alterations in Starling forces contribute to this apparent paradox, shifting fluid from the\\nintravascular to interstitial space.\\n“Inappropriate” secretion of ADH is characterized by the activation of water-conserving mechanisms despite\\nthe absence of osmotic- or volume-related stimuli. Because the renal response to volume expansion remains\\nintact, these patients are typically euvolemic. However, because of the rise in TBW, serum concentrations of\\nNa+ are decreased.\\nThe most common form of this is the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH). This disorder is caused\\nby the nonphysiologic release of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary or an ectopic source. Common\\ncauses of SIADH include neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, acute psychosis,\\ncerebrovascular accident, head trauma), pulmonary diseases (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis, positive-\\npressure ventilation, acute respiratory failure), and malignant tumors (most commonly, small-cell lung\\ncancer).\\nSIADH is diagnosed by the following:\\nHypo-osmotic hyponatremia\\nUrine osmolality >100 mOsm/L\\nEuvolemia\\nThe absence of conditions that stimulate ADH secretion, including volume contraction, nausea,\\nadrenal dysfunction, and hypothyroidism\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

Stupor,\\nseizures, and coma do not usually occur unless the plasma [Na+] falls acutely below 115 mEq/L. In chronic\\nhyponatremia (>3 days in duration), adaptive mechanisms designed to defend cell volume occur and tend\\nto minimize the increase in ICF volume and its symptoms.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nThe underlying cause of hyponatremia can often be ascertained from an accurate history and physical\\nexamination, including an assessment of ECF volume status and the effective circulating volume.\\nThree laboratory analyses, when used with a clinical assessment of volume status, can narrow the\\ndifferential diagnosis of hyponatremia: (a) the plasma osmolality, (b) the urine osmolality, and (c) the\\nurine [Na+] (Figure 12-1).\\nPlasma osmolality. Most patients with hyponatremia have a low plasma osmolality (<275 mOsm/L). If\\nthe plasma osmolality is not low, pseudohyponatremia and hyperosmolar hyponatremia must be\\nruled out.\\nUrine osmolality. The appropriate renal response to hypo-osmolality is to excrete a maximally dilute\\nurine (urine osmolality <100 mOsm/L and specific gravity <1.003). A urine sample that is not dilute\\nsuggests impaired free water excretion due to appropriate or inappropriate secretion of the ADH.\\nUrine [Na+] adds laboratory corroboration to the bedside assessment of effective circulating volume and\\ncan discriminate between extrarenal and renal losses of Na+. The appropriate response to decreased\\neffective circulating volume is to enhance tubular Na+ reabsorption such that urine [Na+] is <10 mEq/L. A\\nurine [Na+] of >20 mEq/L suggests a normal effective circulating volume or a Na+-wasting defect.\\nOccasionally, the excretion of a nonreabsorbed anion obligates loss of the Na+ cation despite volume\\ndepletion (ketonuria, bicarbonaturia).\\nTREATMENT\\nManagement requires one to determine the rate of correction, the appropriate intervention, and the\\npresence of other underlying disorders.\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

CPM results from damage to neurons due to rapid osmotic shifts. In its\\nmost overt form, it is characterized by flaccid paralysis, dysarthria, and dysphagia, and in more subtle\\npresentations, it can be confirmed by CT scan or MRI of the brain. The risk of precipitating CPM is\\nincreased with correction of the [Na+] by >12 mEq/L in a 24-hour period (J Am Soc Nephrol\\n1994;4:1522). In addition to overaggressive correction, other risk factors for developing CPM include\\npreexisting hypokalemia, malnutrition, and alcoholism.\\nIn patients with severe hyponatremia, in whom an immediate rise in [Na+] is necessary, [Na+] should be\\ncorrected 1-2 mEq/L/h for 3-4 hours. However, this initial rate of\\ncorrection should be tapered off once the patient is safe, such that the rise in [Na+] does not exceed\\n10-12 mEq/L over the 24-hour period.\\nChronic asymptomatic hyponatremia. The risk of iatrogenic injury is actually increased in patients\\nwith chronic hyponatremia. Because cells gradually adapt to the hypo-osmolar state, an abrupt\\nnormalization presents a dramatic change from the accommodated osmotic milieu. As such, we suggest a\\nmore modest rate of correction on the order of 5-8 mEq/L over a 24-hour period.\\nSevere, symptomatic hyponatremia. In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, hypertonic saline\\nprovides an immediate and titratable intervention necessary to acutely raise serum Na+ levels while\\navoiding the disastrous complications of overcorrection.\\nThe most accurate way to correct hyponatremia entails a detailed registry matching total solute and\\nwater output with desired input. In clinical practice, this is often impractical.\\nIn lieu of this, the following equation is often used to approximate the change in [Na+] in mEq/L from\\nthe infusion of 1 L of fluid:\\nΔ[Na+] = ([Na+i] + [K+i] − [Na+s]) ÷ {TBW + 1}\\n[Na+i] and [K+i] are the sodium and potassium concentrations in the infused fluid, and [Na+s] is the\\nstarting serum sodium (Intensive Care Med 1997;23:309).

In patients with asymptomatic hypovolemic hyponatremia, isotonic\\nsaline can be used to restore the intravascular volume. Restoration of a euvolemic state will reduce the\\nimpetus toward renal water retention, leading to normalization of [Na+]. If the duration of hyponatremia\\nis unknown, the process described earlier can be used to calculate the expected change from 1 L of\\n0.9% NS, the rate of administration, and the maximal amount that can be given to avoid overcorrection.\\nHypervolemic hyponatremia. Hyponatremia in CHF and cirrhosis often reflects the severity of the\\nunderlying disease. However, the hyponatremia itself is typically asymptomatic. Although effective\\ncirculating volume is decreased, the administration of fluid\\nmay worsen the volume-overloaded state. Definitive treatment requires management of the underlying\\ncondition, although restriction of water intake and increasing water diuresis may help to attenuate the\\ndegree of hyponatremia.\\nOral fluid intake should be less than daily urine output.\\nUrinary excretion of water can be promoted through the use of loop diuretics, which reduce the\\nconcentration gradient necessary to reabsorb water in the distal nephron. Vasopressin antagonists\\nmay also be helpful in both euvolemic (SIADH) and hypervolemic hyponatremia (particularly CHF).\\nWhen using medications to promote water loss, laboratory data and volume status must be followed\\nextremely closely, because the effect on water and electrolyte loss cannot be accurately predicted.\\nSIADH should first be distinguished from the previously listed conditions that stimulate vasopressin\\nsecretion. The standard first-line therapy is water restriction and correction of any contributing factors\\n(nausea, pneumonia, drugs, etc.). If this fails or if the patient is symptomatic, the following can be\\nattempted to promote water excretion.\\nWater restriction. The amount of fluid restriction necessary depends on the extent of water\\nelimination. A useful guide to the necessary degree of fluid restriction is as follows:\\nIf (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ <0.5, restrict to 1 L/d.\\nIf (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ is 0.5-1.0, restrict to 500 mL/d.\\nIf (Urine Na+ + Urine K+)/Serum Na+ is >1, the patient has a negative renal free water clearance and\\nis actively reabsorbing water. Any amount of water given may be retained, and clinicians should\\nconsider the following options to enhance free water excretion.\\nHigh dietary solute load. The volume of water excreted as urine is governed by a relatively fixed\\nurine osmolality. Thus, increasing solute intake with a high-salt, high-protein diet or administration of\\noral urea (30-60 g) may increase the capacity for water excretion and improve the hyponatremia.\\nLoop diuretics impair the urinary concentrating mechanism and can enhance free water excretion.\\nVasopressin antagonists promote a water diuresis and may be useful in the therapy of SIADH. Both IV\\n(conivaptan) and oral (tolvaptan) preparations are approved for the treatment of euvolemic\\nhyponatremia. However, given the risks of overcorrection, these agents should be initiated in a closely\\nmonitored inpatient setting.\\nLithium and demeclocycline interfere with the collecting tubule's ability to respond to ADH but are\\nrarely used because of significant side effects.

For\\nhypernatremia to persist, one or both of these compensatory mechanisms must be impaired.\\nImpaired thirst response may occur in situations where access to water is limited, often due to physical\\nrestrictions (institutionalized, handicapped, postoperative, or intubated patients) or mental impairment\\n(delirium, dementia).\\nHypernatremia due to water loss. The loss of water must occur in excess of electrolyte losses in order to\\nraise [Na+].\\nNonrenal water loss may be due to evaporation from the skin and respiratory tract (insensible losses) or\\nloss from the GI tract. Diarrhea is the most common GI cause of\\nhypernatremia. Osmotic diarrhea (induced by lactulose, sorbitol, or malabsorption of carbohydrate) and viral\\ngastroenteritis, in particular, result in disproportional water loss.\\nRenal water loss results from either osmotic diuresis or diabetes insipidus (DI).\\nOsmotic diuresis is frequently associated with glycosuria and high osmolar feeds. In addition, increased\\nurea generation from accelerated catabolism, high-protein feeds, and stress-dose steroids can also result\\nin an osmotic diuresis.\\nHypernatremia secondary to nonosmotic urinary water loss is usually caused by impaired vasopressin\\nsecretion (central diabetes insipidus [CDI]) or resistance to the actions of vasopressin (nephrogenic\\ndiabetes insipidus [NDI]). Partial defects occur more commonly than complete defects in both types.\\nThe most common cause of CDI is destruction of the neurohypophysis from trauma, neurosurgery,\\ngranulomatous disease, neoplasms, vascular accidents, or infection. In many cases, CDI is idiopathic.\\nNDI may either be inherited or acquired. The latter often results from a disruption to the renal\\nconcentrating mechanism due to drugs (lithium, demeclocycline, amphotericin), electrolyte disorders\\n(hypercalcemia, hypokalemia), medullary washout (loop diuretics), and intrinsic renal diseases.\\nHypernatremia due to primary Na+ gain occurs infrequently due to the kidney's capacity to excrete the\\nretained Na+.

The rapid shift of water into brain cells increases the risk of seizures or permanent neurologic\\ndamage. Therefore, the water deficit should be reduced gradually by roughly 10-12 mEq/L/d.\\nIn chronic asymptomatic hypernatremia, the risk of treatment-related complications is increased due\\nto the cerebral adaptation to the chronic hyperosmolar state. The plasma [Na+] should be lowered at a\\nmore moderate rate (between 5-8 mEq/L/d).\\nIntervention\\nThe mainstay of management is the administration of water, preferably by mouth or nasogastric tube.\\nAlternatively, 5% dextrose in water (D5W) or quarter NS can be given via IV.\\nTraditionally, correction of hypernatremia has been accomplished by calculating free water deficit by\\nthe equation:\\nFree water deficit = {([Na+] − 140)/140} × (TBW)\\nWhile this is helpful in approximating the total water deficit, it does not provide sufficient guidance\\nregarding the rate and content of infusate. Alternatively, we suggest approaching treatment in a\\nmanner similar to that used in the treatment of hyponatremia. The change in [Na+] from the\\nadministration of fluids can be estimated as follows:\\nΔ[Na+] = ([Na+i] + [K+i] − [Na+s]) ÷ (TBW + 1)\\n[Na+i] and [K+i] are the sodium and potassium concentrations in the infused fluid and [Na+s] is the\\nstarting serum sodium (Intensive Care Med 1997;23:309).

However, this should be\\nfollowed closely because it does not account for ongoing GI or insensible losses, which may\\naccount for another 1.4 L/d of water required to keep [Na+] stable.\\nSpecific therapies for the underlying cause\\nHypovolemic hypernatremia. In patients with mild volume depletion, Na+-containing solutions, such\\nas 0.45% NS, can be used to replenish the ECF as well as the water deficit. If patients have severe or\\nsymptomatic volume depletion, correction of volume status with isotonic fluid should take precedence\\nover correction of the hyperosmolar state. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, administration\\nof hypotonic fluid can be given to replace the free water deficit.\\nHypernatremia from primary Na+ gain is unusual. Cessation of iatrogenic Na+ is typically sufficient.\\nDI without hypernatremia. DI is best treated by removing the underlying cause.

This enhances proximal reabsorption of salt and water, thus decreasing urinary\\nfree water loss. Decreasing protein intake will further decrease urine output by minimizing the solute\\nload that must be excreted.\\nPOTASSIUM\\nPotassium is the major intracellular cation. Of the 3000-4000 mEq of K+ found in the average human, 98% is\\nsequestered within cells. Thus, although ECF [K+] is normally 3.5-5.0 mEq/L, the intracellular concentration is\\nroughly 150 mEq/L. This difference in ICF and ECF K+ content is maintained by the Na+/K+-adenosine\\ntriphosphatase pump.\\nThe K+ intake of individuals on an average Western diet is approximately 1 mEq/kg/d, 90% of which is\\nabsorbed by the GI tract. Maintenance of the steady state necessitates matching K+ excretion with ingestion.\\nThe elimination of potassium occurs predominately through renal excretion at the distal nephron. K+\\nsecretion is enhanced by distal Na+ reabsorption, which generates a lumen-negative gradient and distal\\nurine flow rate.\\nRenal potassium handling is responsive to aldosterone, which stimulates the expression of distal luminal Na+\\nchannels, and the serum potassium concentration. Aldosterone secretion is, in turn, responsive to\\nangiotensin II and hyperkalemia.\\nHypokalemia\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nHypokalemia is defined as a plasma [K+] <3.5 mEq/L.\\nSpurious hypokalemia may be seen in situations in which high numbers of metabolically active cells present\\nin the blood sample absorb the ECF potassium.\\nTrue hypokalemia may result from one or more of the following: (a) decreased net intake, (b) shift into\\ncells, or (c) increased net loss.\\nDiminished intake is seldom the sole cause of K+ depletion because urinary excretion can be effectively\\ndecreased to <15 mEq/d. However, dietary K+ restriction may exacerbate the hypokalemia from GI or renal\\nloss.\\nTranscellular shift. Movement of K+ into cells may transiently decrease the plasma [K+] without altering\\ntotal body K+ content. These shifts can result from alkalemia, insulin, and catecholamine release. Periodic\\nparalysis is a rare disorder that predisposes patients to transcellular K+ shifts that result in episodic muscle\\nweakness. Both hyperkalemic and hypokalemic forms have been described and can be triggered after\\nstrenuous exercise. Unlike the hyperkalemic form, the hypokalemic form can be triggered after a\\ncarbohydrate-rich meal. In the hyperkalemic form, the potassium levels are usually mildly elevated during an\\nattack.

This can be achieved with the reabsorption of a cation (Na+) or presence of a nonreabsorbed\\nanion.\\nDistal Na+ reabsorption is largely influenced by mineralocorticoid activity.\\nPrimary mineralocorticoid excess can be seen in primary hyperaldosteronism due to an adrenal\\nadenoma or adrenocortical hyperplasia.\\nCortisol also has an affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors but is typically converted quickly to\\ncortisone, which has markedly less mineralocorticoid activity.

The finding of metabolic acidosis in\\na patient with hypokalemia thus narrows the differential significantly, implying lower GI loss, distal RTA,\\nor the excretion of a nonreabsorbable anion from an organic acid (diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA], hippurate\\nfrom toluene intoxication).\\nECG changes associated with hypokalemia include flattening or inversion of the T wave, a prominent U\\nwave, ST-segment depression, and a prolonged QU interval. Severe K+ depletion may result in a\\nprolonged PR interval, decreased voltage, and widening of the QRS complex.\\nTREATMENT\\nThe therapeutic goals are to safely correct the K+ deficit and to minimize ongoing losses through\\ntreatment of the underlying cause. Hypomagnesemia should also be sought in all hypokalemic patients and\\ncorrected to allow effective K+ repletion.\\nCorrection of the K+ deficit can be accomplished with either oral or IV therapy.\\nOral therapy. It is generally safer to correct the K+ deficit via the oral route when hypokalemia is mild\\nand the patient can tolerate oral administration. Oral doses of 40 mEq are generally well tolerated and\\ncan be given as often as every 4 hours. Traditionally, 10 mEq of potassium salts are given for each 0.10\\nmEq/L decrement in serum [K+]. However, with increasing severity of hypokalemia, this grossly\\nunderestimates the K+ necessary to normalize total K+ content. Furthermore, as the K+ shifts back to the\\nintracellular space, it may appear as though K+ supplementation is doing very little to correct ECF [K+]. In\\nsuch cases, potassium supplementation should be increased and continued until serum levels rise.\\nIV therapy. Patients with imminently life-threatening hypokalemia and those who are unable to take\\nanything by mouth require IV replacement therapy with KCl. The maximum concentration of administered\\nK+ should be no more than 40 mEq/L via a peripheral vein or 100 mEq/L via a central vein. The rate of\\ninfusion should not exceed 20 mEq/h unless paralysis or malignant ventricular arrhythmias are present.\\nIdeally, KCl should be mixed in NS because dextrose solutions may initially exacerbate hypokalemia (as a\\nresult of insulin-mediated movement of K+). Rapid IV administration of K+ should be used judiciously and\\nrequires close observation.\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

Contributing factors include repeated fist clenching, hemolysis,\\nand marked leukocytosis or thrombocytosis.\\nTrue hyperkalemia occurs as a result of (a) transcellular shift, (b) increased exposure to K+, and most\\ncommonly, (c) decreased renal K+ excretion. Combinations of these mechanisms often underlie cases of\\nhyperkalemia in clinical practice, and decreased renal excretion is nearly always some component of the\\npathophysiology.\\nTranscellular shift. Insulin deficiency, hyperosmolality, nonselective β-blockers, digitalis, metabolic\\nacidosis (excluding those from organic acids), and depolarizing muscle relaxants, such as succinylcholine,\\nrelease K+ from predominate ICF stores into the ECF compartment. Exercise-induced hyperkalemia results\\nfrom release of K+ from muscles. Familial periodic paralysis, mentioned previously, is a rare cause of\\nhyperkalemia. Massive cellular destruction, as seen in tumor lysis syndrome, also liberates cellular K+\\nstores and releases them into the ECF.\\nIncreased exposure to K+ is rarely the sole cause of hyperkalemia unless there is an impairment in renal\\nexcretion. Foods with a high content of K+ include salt substitutes,\\ndried fruits, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, spinach, bananas, and oranges. Juices derived from these foods may\\nbe especially rich sources.\\nDecreased renal K+ excretion. In the setting of hyperkalemia, the kidney is capable of generating a\\nsignificant urinary excretion of K+. This process can be impaired by a number of processes, including\\nintrinsic renal disease, decreased delivery of filtrate to the distal nephron, adrenal insufficiency, and\\nhyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (type 4 RTA).\\nDrugs may also be implicated in the genesis of hyperkalemia through a variety of mechanisms. Common\\nculprits include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, potassium-sparing\\ndiuretics, NSAIDs, and cyclosporine. Heparin and ketoconazole can also contribute to hyperkalemia through\\nthe decreased production of aldosterone, although these agents alone are typically insufficient to sustain a\\nclinically significant hyperkalemia.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nThe most serious effect of hyperkalemia is cardiac arrhythmogenesis secondary to potassium's pivotal\\nrole in membrane potentials. Patients may present with palpitations, syncope, or even sudden cardiac\\ndeath.\\nSevere hyperkalemia causes partial depolarization of the skeletal muscle cell membrane and may\\nmanifest as weakness, potentially progressing to flaccid paralysis and hypoventilation if the respiratory\\nmuscles are involved.\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com\"),\n",

Acute therapy may\\nconsist of some or all of the following (the hypokalemic effect is additive).\\nCalcium gluconate decreases membrane excitability but does not lower [K+]. The usual dose is 10 mL\\nof a 10% solution infused over 2-3 minutes. The effect begins within minutes but is short lived (30-60\\nminutes), and the dose can be repeated if no improvement in the ECG is seen after 5-10 minutes.\\nInsulin causes K+ to shift into cells and temporarily lowers the plasma [K+]. A commonly used\\ncombination is 10-20 units of regular insulin and 25-50 g of glucose administered IV. Hyperglycemic\\npatients should be given the insulin alone.\\nNaHCO3 is effective for severe hyperkalemia associated with metabolic acidosis. In the acute setting, it\\ncan be given as an IV isotonic solution (three ampules of NaHCO3 in 1 L of 5% dextrose).\\nβ2-Adrenergic agonists promote cellular uptake of K+.

Nearly 50% of serum\\ncalcium is ionized (free), whereas the remainder is complexed to albumin (40%) and anions such as\\nphosphate (10%).\\nCalcium balance is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol.\\nPTH increases serum calcium by stimulating bone resorption, increasing calcium reclamation in the kidney,\\nand promoting renal conversion of vitamin D to calcitriol. Serum calcium regulates PTH secretion by a\\nnegative feedback mechanism: Hypocalcemia stimulates and hypercalcemia suppresses PTH release.\\nCalcitriol [1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or 1,25(OH)2D3] is the active form of\\nvitamin D.

Rarely, osteitis fibrosa cystica can develop when hyperparathyroidism is\\nprofound and prolonged, resulting in “brown tumors” and marrow replacement.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nThe history and physical examination should focus on (a) the duration of symptoms of hypercalcemia, (b)\\nclinical evidence of any of the unusual causes of hypercalcemia, and (c) symptoms and signs of\\nmalignancy (which almost always precede malignant hypercalcemia).

The following regimen is presented in the order that therapy should be given.\\nCorrection of hypovolemia with 0.9% saline fluid is mandatory in patients who demonstrate volume\\ndepletion, because hypovolemia prevents effective calciuresis. Maintenance fluids can be continued\\nafter achieving euvolemia to sustain a urine output of 100-150 mL/h. The patient should be monitored\\nclosely for signs of volume overload.\\nLoop diuretics can be used if signs of volume overload limit further saline administration while\\nhypercalcemia persists. These agents reduce paracellular reabsorption of calcium in the loop of Henle\\nand thus may slightly enhance calcium excretion. They should not be used in euvolemic or\\nhypovolemic patients because they may further contract the ECF volume and prevent adequate\\nrestoration of the volume status.\\nIV bisphosphonates can be used to decrease the liberation of calcium from bone in persistent\\nhypercalcemia. Pamidronate 60 mg is infused over 2-4 hours; for severe hypercalcemia (>13.5 mg/dL),\\n90 mg can be given over the same duration. A hypocalcemic response is typically seen within 2 days\\nand may persist for 2 weeks or longer. Treatment can be repeated after 7 days if hypercalcemia\\nrecurs. Zoledronate is a more potent bisphosphonate that is given as a 4-mg dose infused over at least\\n15 minutes. Hydration should precede bisphosphonate use. Renal insufficiency is a relative\\ncontraindication.\\nOther options\\nCalcitonin inhibits bone resorption and increases renal calcium excretion. Salmon calcitonin, 4-8 IU/kg\\nIM or SC q6-12h, lowers serum calcium 1-2 mg/dL within several hours in 60-70% of patients. Although\\nit is less potent than other inhibitors of bone resorption, it has no serious toxicity, is safe in renal\\nfailure, and may have an analgesic effect in patients with skeletal metastases.\\nGlucocorticoids are effective in hypercalcemia due to hematologic malignancies and granulomatous\\nproduction of calcitriol. The initial dose is 20-60 mg/d of prednisone or its equivalent. After serum\\ncalcium stabilizes, the dose should be gradually reduced to the minimum needed to control symptoms\\nof hypercalcemia. Toxicity (see Chapter 25, Arthritis and Rheumatologic Diseases) limits the\\nusefulness of glucocorticoids for long-term therapy.\\nGallium nitrate inhibits bone resorption as effectively as the IV bisphosphonates and has a similar\\ndelayed onset of 2 days. It is given as a 100- to 200-mg/m2/d continuous infusion for up to 5 days,\\nunless normocalcemia is achieved sooner.

Reduced PTH activity can result from decreased PTH release from\\nautoimmune, infiltrative, or iatrogenic (e.g., postthyroidectomy) destruction of parathyroid tissue. In rare\\npatients, hypoparathyroidism is congenital, as in DiGeorge syndrome or familial hypocalcemia. Release of\\nPTH is also impaired with both hypomagnesemia (<1 mg/dL) and severe hypermagnesemia (>6 mg/dL).\\nVitamin D deficiency lowers total body calcium but does not usually affect serum calcium levels unless the\\ndeficiency is severe, because the resultant secondary hyperparathyroidism often corrects serum calcium\\nlevels. Significant vitamin D deficiency can occur in the elderly or those with limited sun exposure, in advanced\\nliver disease (due to decreased synthesis of precursors), and in nephrotic syndrome.

In acute, symptomatic hypocalcemia with severe hyperphosphatemia, dialysis may be\\nneeded to acutely manage the mineral abnormalities.

Two\\ngrams of magnesium sulfate can be given IV over 15 minutes followed by an infusion (see Magnesium,\\nHypomagnesemia, Treatment section) and may even be given empirically if renal failure is not present.\\nCalcium supplementation. IV calcium should be reserved for severe or symptomatic hypocalcemia and\\ncan be administered as calcium chloride or calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate is typically favored due\\nto reduced risk of tissue toxicity with extravasation. Calcium gluconate is often prepared as a 10%\\nsolution (100 mg of calcium gluconate per mL). One ampule (10 mL) of calcium gluconate thus contains\\n1000 mg of calcium gluconate and approximately 90 mg of elemental calcium.\\nWhen necessary to treat severe or symptomatic hypocalcemia, an initial dose of 90-180 mg of\\nelemental calcium can be achieved with 1-2 g of calcium gluconate (equal to 10-20 mL or one to two\\nampules of 10% calcium gluconate) mixed in 50-100 mL of D5W administered over 10-20 minutes.\\nThe effect of initial treatment is only transient, and maintenance of calcium levels typically requires a\\ncontinuous infusion of 0.5-1.5 mg/kg/h of elemental calcium. A solution comprised of 1 L D5W with 100\\nmL of 10% calcium gluconate contains approximately 900 mg of elemental calcium per liter,\\napproximating 1 mg of elemental calcium per milliliter of fluid. Infusion is typically begun at a rate of 50\\nmL/h (approximately 50 mg of elemental calcium per hour) and titrated up as needed.\\nChronic management. Treatment requires calcium supplements and vitamin D or its active metabolite\\nto increase intestinal calcium absorption.\\nOral calcium supplements. Calcium carbonate (40% elemental calcium) or calcium acetate (25%\\nelemental calcium) can be given with the goal administration of 1-2 g of elemental calcium PO tid.\\nCalcium supplementation should be given apart from meals to minimize binding with phosphorus and\\nmaximize enteric absorption. Serum levels should be checked once to twice per week to guide ongoing\\ntherapy.\\nVitamin D. Simple dietary deficiency can be corrected by the use of ergocalciferol 400-1000 IU/d.\\nHowever, in conjunction with other hypocalcemic disorders, larger doses may be required. A 6- to 8-\\nweek regimen of 50,000 IU should be dosed weekly in those with underlying impairments in vitamin D\\nmetabolism (i.e., renal insufficiency) and daily in patients with severe malnutrition or malabsorption.\\nIn comparison, calcitriol has a much more rapid onset of action. The initial dosage is 0.25 μg daily,\\nand most patients are maintained on 0.5-2.0 μg daily. The dose can be increased at 2- to 4-week\\nintervals. Because calcitriol increases enteric absorption of phosphorus as well as calcium,\\nphosphorus levels should be monitored and oral phosphate binders initiated if phosphorus exceeds the\\nnormal range.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nDevelopment of hypercalcemia. In the event that hypercalcemia develops, vitamin D and calcium\\nsupplements should be stopped.

Chronic\\nalcoholism is often associated with poor intake of both phosphate and vitamin D, resulting in total body\\nphosphorus depletion.\\nIncreased renal excretion occurs with high levels of PTH, as seen in hyperparathyroidism. This can be\\nparticularly pronounced in patients with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism who undergo renal\\ntransplantation, because the high PTH causes a profound phosphaturic effect on the functional allograft.\\nHypophosphatemia may also occur from osmotic diuresis and disorders of proximal tubular transport such\\nas familial X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and Fanconi syndrome.\\nTranscellular shift is stimulated by respiratory alkalosis as well as insulin. The latter is responsible for the\\nparadoxical reduction in phosphorus during treatment of malnutrition with hyperalimentation (the refeeding\\nsyndrome). The endogenous increase in insulin during treatment shifts phosphorus intracellularly, further\\nreducing serum phosphorus in the malnourished individual. Phosphorus can also be rapidly absorbed into\\nbone following parathyroidectomy for severe hyperparathyroidism (hungry bone syndrome).\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nSigns and symptoms typically occur only if total body phosphate depletion is present and the serum\\nphosphorus level is <1 mg/dL.

Three general mechanisms exist to keep it within a\\nnarrow window:\\nChemical buffering is mediated by HCO3- in the ECF and by protein and phosphate buffers in the ICF.\\nThe normal [HCO3-] is 24 ± 2 mEq/L.\\nAlveolar ventilation minimizes variations in the pH by altering the pCO2. The normal pCO2 is 40 ± 5 mm\\nHg.\\nRenal H+ handling allows the kidney to adapt to changes in acid-base status via HCO3- reabsorption and\\nexcretion of titratable acid (e.g., H2PO4-) and NH4+.\\nAcidemia and alkalemia refer to processes that lower and raise pH regardless of mechanism. They can be\\ncaused by metabolic or respiratory disturbances:\\nMetabolic acidosis is characterized by a decrease in the plasma [HCO3-] due to either HCO3- loss or the\\naccumulation of acid.\\nMetabolic alkalosis is characterized by an elevation in the plasma [HCO3-] due to either H+ loss or HCO3-\\ngain.\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

Check arterial blood gas. Acidemia is present when pH is <7.37 and alkalemia when pH >7.43.\\nStep 2. Establish the primary disturbance by determining whether the change in [HCO3-] or pCO2 can\\naccount for the observed deflection in pH.\\nIn acidemia, a decreased [HCO3-] suggests metabolic acidosis, and an elevated pCO2 suggests\\nrespiratory acidosis. In alkalemia, an elevated [HCO3-] suggests metabolic alkalosis, whereas a\\ndecreased pCO2 suggests respiratory alkalosis.\\nA combined disorder is present when pH is normal but the pCO2 and [HCO3-] are both abnormal.\\nChanges in both pCO2 and [HCO3-] can cause the change in pH.\\nStep 3. Determine whether compensation is appropriate.\\nThe compensatory mechanism is an adaptation to the primary acid-base disturbance intended to\\nstabilize the changing pH. A respiratory process that shifts the pH in one direction will be compensated\\nby a metabolic process that shifts the pH in the other and vice versa.\\nThe effect of compensation is to attenuate, but not completely correct, the primary change in pH.\\nThe expected compensations for the various primary acid-base derangements are given in Table 12-2.\\nAn inappropriate compensatory response suggests the presence of a combined disorder.\\nExample: In a patient with metabolic acidosis, respiratory compensation attenuates the metabolic\\ndisturbance to pH by lowering pCO2. However, if the pCO2 is higher than expected, respiratory\\ncompensation is insufficient, revealing a respiratory acidosis with the primary metabolic acidosis. If\\npCO2 is lower than expected, compensation is excessive, revealing a concomitant respiratory\\nalkalosis.\\nStep 4. Determine the anion gap.\\nIn normal individuals, the total serum cations are balanced with the total serum anions. Total cations\\nare comprised of measured cations (MCs) and unmeasured cations (UCs), whereas total anions are\\ncomprised of measured anions (MAs) and unmeasured anions (UAs).

Many of the causes seen in clinical practice can be found in Table 12-3.\\nAG acidosis results from exposure to acids, which contribute an unmeasured anion to the ECF. Common\\ncauses are DKA, lactic acidosis, and toxic alcohol ingestions.\\nNon-anion gap acidosis can result from the loss of [HCO3-] from the GI tract. Renal causes due to renal\\nexcretion of [HCO3-] or disorders of renal acid handling are referred to collectively as renal tubular acidoses\\n(RTAs).\\nEnteric [HCO3-] loss occurs most commonly in the setting of severe diarrhea.\\nThe three forms of RTA correlate with the three mechanisms that facilitate renal acid handling: proximal\\nbicarbonate reabsorption, distal H+ secretion, and generation of NH3, the principle urinary buffer. Urinary\\nbuffers reduce the concentration of free H+ in the filtrate, thus attenuating the back leak of H+, which occurs at\\nlow urinary pH.\\nProximal (type 2) RTA is caused by impaired proximal tubular HCO3- reabsorption. Causes include\\ninherited mutations (cystinosis), heavy metals, drugs (tenofovir, ifosfamide, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors),\\nand multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies.\\nDistal (type 1) RTA results from impaired distal H+ secretion. This may occur due to impairment in H+\\nsecretion, as seen with a variety of autoimmune (Sjögren syndrome,\\nlupus, rheumatoid arthritis) or renal disorders. Hypercalciuria is another main cause of distal RTA in adults.\\nIt can also be caused by a back leak of H+ due to increased membrane permeability, as seen with\\namphotericin B.\\nDistal hyperkalemic (type 4) RTA may result from either low aldosterone levels or from aldosterone\\nresistance. The resulting hyperkalemia reduces the availability of NH3 to buffer urinary H+. Hyporeninemic\\nhypoaldosteronism is seen with some frequency in patients with diabetes. Certain drugs, including NSAIDs,\\nβ-blockers, and cyclosporine, have also been implicated.\\nOccasionally, the kidney is unable to secrete sufficient H+ due to an impaired luminal gradient. In these\\nsituations, poor filtrate delivery or impaired Na+ reabsorption in the distal nephron is responsible for\\ndecreasing the voltage gradient, which augments H+ secretion. This can be seen with marked volume\\ndepletion, urinary tract obstruction, sickle cell nephropathy, and amiloride or triamterene use.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nThe first step in narrowing the differential diagnosis for a metabolic acidosis is to calculate the anion gap.\\nThe specific cause of an elevated anion gap can usually be determined by clinical history. However,\\nspecific laboratory studies are available to identify certain anions such as lactate, acetoacetate, acetone,\\nand β-hydroxybutyrate. (It should be noted that the use of nitroprusside to detect ketones may fail to\\nidentify ketoacidosis due to β-hydroxybutyrate.)

Clinical suspicion for toxic alcohol ingestion is\\ncorroborated by an increased osmolal gap. This gap is the difference between measured and calculated\\nserum osmolality:\\n[Osm]meas − {([Na+] × 2) + ([glucose] ÷ 18) + ([BUN] ÷ 2.8)}\\nIf a normal anion gap is present, the GI HCO3- losses can be differentiated from RTAs via the urine\\nanion gap (UAG). The UAG is the difference between the major measured anions and cations in urine:\\n[Na+]u + [K+]u − [Cl-]u. Because NH4+ is the major unmeasured urinary cation, a negative UAG reflects\\nhigh NH4+ excretion, an appropriate response to a metabolic acidosis. Conversely, a positive UAG\\nsignifies low NH4+ excretion, which in the face of a metabolic acidosis suggests a renal tubular defect.\\nSerum [K+] and urine pH can be helpful in distinguishing between the RTAs.\\nTypes 1 and 2 are typically associated with hypokalemia, whereas type 4 is characterized by\\nhyperkalemia.\\nUrine pH is low (usually <5.3) in type 4 RTA because the defect is in the generation of the NH3 buffer,\\nand the mechanism for H+ secretion is intact. In contrast, urine pH is inappropriately high in type 1 RTA\\n(urine pH >5.3). In type 2 RTA, the urine pH is variable. It is elevated during the initial bicarbonaturia,\\nwhen filtered bicarbonate exceeds the threshold for reabsorption, and low when the filtered load is\\nbelow this threshold.\\nTREATMENT\\nKetoacidosis attributable to ethanol abuse and starvation can be corrected with the resumption of\\ncaloric intake through oral intake or dextrose-containing fluids and by correction of any volume depletion\\nthat may be present. The treatment of DKA is described in Chapter 23, Diabetes Mellitus and Related\\nDisorders.\\nLactic acidosis will resolve once the underlying cause is treated and tissue perfusion is restored. Often,\\nthis involves aggressive therapeutic maneuvers for the treatment of shock as described in Chapter 8,\\nCritical Care. The administration of alkali does not appear to have clear benefit\\nin lactic acidosis, and it may lead to a rebound metabolic alkalosis once the underlying cause is\\nmanaged. Its use in dire circumstances or severe acidosis remains controversial.\\nManagement of toxic ingestions is described in Chapter 28, Toxicology.\\nNormal AG metabolic acidosis. Treatment with NaHCO3 is appropriate for patients with a normal AG\\nmetabolic acidosis.

In reality, the\\ndistribution of HCO3- increases with the severity of the acidosis and may exceed 100% of total body\\nweight in very severe acidosis. It should be noted that the standard 650-mg tablet of oral NaHCO3\\nprovides only 7 mEq of HCO3-, whereas one ampule of IV NaHCO3 contains 50 mEq.

Correction of the chronic acidemia with alkali administration is warranted in\\norder to prevent its catabolic effect on bone and muscle.\\nIn distal (type 1) RTA, correction of the metabolic acidosis requires oral HCO3- replacement on the\\norder of 1-2 mEq/kg/d with NaHCO3 or sodium citrate.

The latter may result from the loss of H+-\\nrich fluids, including upper GI secretions. Contraction alkalosis refers to the contraction of volume around a\\nfixed content of bicarbonate.\\nMaintenance requires a concomitant impairment in renal HCO3- excretion, because the kidney normally has a\\nlarge capacity to excrete HCO3-. This occurs as a result of a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or\\nenhanced tubular HCO3- reabsorption from chloride depletion, volume contraction, and hypokalemia. A\\ndecrease in filtered chloride is sensed by the macula densa and, as a result of tubuloglomerular feedback,\\nreduces filtered HCO3- and stimulates aldosterone release. It also limits adaptive distal HCO3- secretion.\\nMetabolic alkalosis is often described as being chloride responsive or chloride unresponsive.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nBecause key causes of metabolic alkalosis are related to volume contraction, patients may present with\\nsigns of volume depletion.

An\\nabnormal urinalysis or sediment, with proteinuria, hematuria, or pyuria, may also indicate renal disease.\\nWhen the decline in renal function is acute or advanced, a variety of nonspecific symptoms may be\\npresent. Generalized malaise, worsening hypertension, dependent or generalized edema, or decreasing\\nurine output may accompany more severe renal insufficiency.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nThe focus of the initial evaluation of the patient with renal disease is to determine the need for emergent\\ndialysis. Then, investigations to identify the etiology are undertaken, while differentiating components of\\nacute and chronic disease.\\nBasic diagnostic testing\\nA basic evaluation includes electrolytes (with calcium and phosphorus), Cr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),\\nand albumin. When Cr is stable over days to weeks, it can be used to estimate glomerular filtration rate\\n(GFR), which can be calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula for Cr clearance:\\n[(140 - age) (ideal body weight in kg) (0.85 for women)] / (72 × Cr in mg/dL)\\nHowever, as Cr is secreted by the tubules, particularly as renal function worsens, this formula has the\\ntendency to overestimate the GFR.\\nThe Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas can calculate the GFR and take into\\naccount BUN, albumin, and race in addition to age and gender (http://mdrd.com). When the MDRD\\nGFR is >60 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic kidney disease (CKD) should not be diagnosed unless other\\nevidence of renal damage (e.g., proteinuria) is present.\\nThe Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation is based on\\nthe same variables as the MDRD equation but performs better and with less bias than the MDRD\\nequation, especially in patients with higher GFR.\\nUrine studies\\nRoutine urine studies include a urine dipstick (for protein, blood, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, pH,\\nand specific gravity) as well as a freshly voided specimen for microscopic examination (looking for cells,\\ncasts, and crystals).

The effective circulating volume is decreased, resulting from intravascular volume\\ndepletion, low cardiac output, or disordered vasodilation (hepatic cirrhosis).\\nWhen the cause is true volume depletion, presentation involves a history of excessive fluid loss, reduced\\nintake, or orthostatic symptoms. The physical exam may reveal dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and\\northostatic vital signs (drop in blood pressure by at least 20/10 mm Hg or an increase in heart rate by 10 bpm\\nafter standing from a seated or lying position). The central venous pressure is typically <8 cm H2O.\\nLow cardiac output causes prerenal azotemia via a drop in the effective circulating volume, despite total body\\nvolume overload. In addition, sympathetic and neurohormonal systems are activated, leading to the stimulation\\nof the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as well as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), promoting further salt and\\nwater retention. This can lead to increased reabsorption of urea nitrogen in relation to creatinine, and patients\\npresent with a prerenal pattern on laboratory investigations. In heart failure, diuresis may paradoxically\\nimprove the prerenal azotemia by unloading the ventricles and improving cardiac function (see Chapter 5,\\nHeart Failure and Cardiomyopathy). The use of ultrafiltration was evaluated and found to be inferior to\\npharmacologic therapies; it resulted in more adverse events in the treatment of acute decompensated heart\\nfailure ( N Engl J Med 2012;367:2296-304).\\nHepatic failure leads to splanchnic vasodilation and venous pooling, which diminishes the effective circulating\\nvolume and activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system along with ADH secretion, despite total body\\nvolume overload. This can progress to the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is characterized by a rise in\\nserum creatinine of >1.5 mg/dL that is not reduced with administration of albumin (1 g/kg of body weight) and\\nafter a minimum of 2 days off diuretics. The diagnosis of HRS should be in the absence of shock, nephrotoxic\\nagents, or findings of renal parenchymal disease (N Engl J Med 2009;361:1279). Spontaneous bacterial\\nperitonitis, overdiuresis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or large-volume paracentesis can precipitate HRS in a\\ncirrhotic patient.

When the upper urinary tract is involved,\\nurologic or radiologic decompression is necessary, with stenting or placement of percutaneous nephrostomy\\ntubes.\\nRelief of bilateral obstruction is frequently followed by a postobstructive diuresis.

These forms share many of the diagnostic features of ischemic\\nATN.\\nIodinated contrast is a potent renal vasoconstrictor and is toxic to renal tubules. When renal injury\\noccurs, the Cr typically rises 24 hours after exposure and peaks in 3-5 days. Risk factors for contrast\\nnephropathy include CKD, diabetes, volume depletion, heart failure, higher contrast volumes, and use of\\nhyperosmolar contrast.

Alternatively, sodium bicarbonate at 150 mEq/L (three ampules in 5% dextrose in\\nwater [D5W]) can be given at 3 mL/kg/h for 1 hour prior to exposure, then at 1 mL/kg/h for 6 hours\\nafter the procedure (Cardiology 2014;128:62).

Replacement of these electrolytes\\nmay become necessary. A similar pattern of potassium and magnesium loss is seen in cisplatin toxicity. A\\nprolonged exposure to the aminoglycoside of at least 5 days is required. Peak and trough levels correlate\\npoorly with the risk of developing renal injury. Risk may be minimized by avoiding volume depletion and\\nby using the extended-interval dosing method (see Chapter 15, Antimicrobials).\\nPigment nephropathy results from direct tubular toxicity by hemoglobin and myoglobin.\\nVasoconstriction may also play a role. The diagnosis may be suspected by a positive urine dipstick test\\nfor blood but an absence of RBCs on microscopic examination. In rhabdomyolysis, the creatine kinase\\n(CK) level is elevated to at least 10 times the upper limit of normal with a disproportionate rise in Cr,\\npotassium, and phosphorus. Aggressive IV fluid administration should be initiated immediately, and large\\nvolumes are required to replace the fluid lost into necrotic muscle tissue. If urine flow is established,\\nalkalinization with sodium bicarbonate (150 mEq/L, three ampules) can increase the solubility of these\\npigments, although this maneuver may worsen the hypocalcemia.\\nIn tumor lysis syndrome, acute uric acid nephropathy can result. In addition to the elevated Cr, there is\\ntypically hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. A ratio of urine uric acid to urine Cr that\\nis >1 is consistent with this diagnosis, as is the finding of uric acid crystals in the urine sediment.\\nProphylaxis with allopurinol 600 mg can decrease uric acid production. Rasburicase (15 mg/kg IV) is\\nhighly effective at depleting uric acid levels and can be given as prophylaxis or as treatment.\\nAlkalinization of the urine should be avoided if hyperphosphatemia is present because this could increase\\nthe risk of calcium phosphate precipitation in the urine.\\nGlomerular/vascular\\nThe finding of dysmorphic urinary RBCs, RBC casts, or proteinuria in the nephrotic range (>3.5 g/d)\\nstrongly suggests the presence of a glomerular disease. Glomerular diseases are described individually in\\nfurther detail later in this chapter.\\nA small subgroup of glomerular diseases can present with rapidly deteriorating renal function, termed\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

A nephritic picture is common, with RBC casts, edema,\\nand hypertension. A renal biopsy may reveal the specific underlying disease, but crescent formation in\\n>50% of glomeruli is usually present. For those deemed to have salvageable renal function, management is\\nwith highdose pulse glucocorticoid therapy (IV methylprednisolone 7-15 mg/kg/d for 3 days) followed by a\\ncourse of oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d for 1 month, then tapered over the next 6-12 months).\\nCyclophosphamide is typically added to this regimen, with monthly IV doses (1 g/m2) having less cumulative\\ntoxicity than the daily oral dosing strategy (2 mg/kg/d).\\nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) includes both hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic\\nthrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Causes include diarrheal bacterial toxins and medications (mitomycin\\nC, clopidogrel, cyclosporine, tacrolimus), and it may be associated with pregnancy or malignancies of the\\ngastrointestinal tract. Atypical HUS has been described in patients with mutations in the genes coding for\\nproteins that regulate the complement cascade, such as factor H and factor I. These patients have normal\\nADAMTS13 activity and do not have Shiga toxin-associated diarrhea. Eculizumab has been found to be a\\nsafe and effective way of treating atypical HUS (Pediatr Nephrol 2014;29:841). Diagnosis and therapy are\\ndiscussed in Chapter 20, Disorders of Hemostasis and Thrombosis.\\nAtheroembolic disease can be seen in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis after undergoing an invasive\\naortic or other large artery manipulation, including cardiac catheterization, coronary bypass surgery, aortic\\naneurysm repair, and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Physical findings may include retinal\\narteriolar plaques, lower extremity livedo reticularis, and areas of digital necrosis. Eosinophilia,\\neosinophiluria, and hypocomplementemia may be present, and WBC casts may be found in the urine\\nsediment. However, in many cases, the only laboratory abnormality is a rising Cr that follows a stepwise\\nprogression. Renal biopsy shows cholesterol clefts in the small arteries. Anticoagulation may worsen\\nembolic disease and should be avoided if possible. No specific treatment is available. Many patients\\nprogress to CKD and even to endstage renal disease (ESRD).\\nInterstitial\\nAIN involves inflammation of the renal parenchyma, typically caused by medications or infections. The\\nclassic triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia is seen in less than one-third of patients, and its absence\\ndoes not exclude the diagnosis. Pyuria, WBC casts, and eosinophiluria are also suggestive of AIN. β-\\nLactam antibiotics are the most frequently cited causative agents, but nearly all antibiotics can be\\nimplicated.

The basis for these tests is to evaluate tubular integrity, which is preserved\\nin prerenal disease and lost in ATN.

In the blood, the ratio of BUN to Cr is normally <20:1, and an elevation is consistent\\nwith hypovolemia.\\nTREATMENT\\nDisease-specific therapies were covered earlier. In general, treatment of AKI is primarily supportive in\\nnature. Volume status must be evaluated to correct for hypovolemia or hypervolemia. Volume deficits, if\\npresent, should be corrected, after which the goal of fluid management should be to keep input equal to\\noutput. In the oliguric volume-overloaded setting, a trial of diuretics (usually high-dose loop diuretics in a\\nbolus or as a continuous drip) may simplify management, although it has not been shown to hasten\\nrecovery.\\nElectrolyte imbalances should be corrected in the setting of AKI. Hyperkalemia, when mild (<6 mEq/L),\\nmay be treated with dietary potassium restriction and potassium-binding resins (e.g., sodium polystyrene\\nsulfonate). When further elevated or accompanied by ECG abnormalities, immediate medical therapy is\\nindicated, with calcium gluconate, insulin and glucose, inhaled β-agonists, and possibly bicarbonate (see\\nChapter 12, Fluid and Electrolyte Management). Severe hyperkalemia that is refractory to medical\\nmanagement is an indication for urgent dialysis.\\nMild metabolic acidosis can be treated with oral sodium bicarbonate, 650-1300 mg thrice daily. Severe\\nacidosis (pH <7.2) can be temporized with IV sodium bicarbonate but requires monitoring for volume\\noverload, rebound alkalosis, and hypocalcemia. Acidosis that is refractory to medical management is an\\nindication for urgent dialysis.\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nAll patients with AKI require daily assessment to determine the need for renal replacement therapy. Severe\\nacidosis, hyperkalemia, or volume overload refractory to medical\\nmanagement mandates the initiation of dialysis. Certain drug and alcohol intoxications (methanol, ethylene\\nglycol, or salicylates) should be treated with hemodialysis. Uremic pericarditis (with a friction rub) or\\nencephalopathy should also be treated promptly with renal replacement therapy. Patients suffering from\\nacute oliguric renal failure who are not expected to recover promptly likely benefit from earlier initiation of\\ndialysis.\\nGlomerulopathies\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nThe presentation of glomerular diseases can be thought of as existing on a continuum.

Nephrotic diseases typically show injury along the\\nfiltration barrier, with thickening of the GBM or fusion of the podocyte foot processes. By comparison, nephritic\\ndiseases generally show varying degrees of mesangial cell proliferation and mesangial deposition and, with\\nmore aggressive disease, may reveal crescent formation.\\nNephrotic diseases are more likely to be minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental\\nglomerulosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, and deposition dysproteinemias.\\nNephritic syndromes are more likely to be membranoproliferative glomerulonephropathy, IgA\\nnephropathy/Henoch-Schönlein purpura, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, anti-GBM disease,\\nand granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\\nTREATMENT\\nMany disorders share the same features, and general therapeutic maneuvers can be addressed as a\\ngroup. Specific therapies for individual glomerular diseases are discussed in the following text.\\nGlomerular disease presenting with proteinuria should rely on treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs to\\nreduce the intraglomerular pressure. Efficacy can be monitored by serial urine protein-to-Cr ratios.\\nElectrolytes and Cr should be checked within 1-2 weeks of initiation of therapy or an increase in dose to\\ndocument stability of renal function and potassium. Modest dietary protein restriction to 0.8 g/kg/d may\\nslow progression, but this remains controversial.\\nEdema and volume overload can usually be effectively managed with diuretics combined with sodium\\nrestriction. Aggressive treatment of hypertension can also slow progression of renal disease.\\nThe hyperlipidemia associated with the nephrotic syndrome responds to dietary modification and statins\\n(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors).\\nThe nephrotic syndrome produces a hypercoagulable state and can predispose to thromboembolic\\ncomplications. Deep venous thrombi and renal vein thrombosis may occur and should be treated with\\nheparin anticoagulation followed by long-term warfarin therapy. Prophylactic anticoagulation is\\ncontroversial and may be beneficial in severely nephrotic patients, particularly with membranous\\nnephropathy (MN). Exact mechanisms of thrombosis remain controversial but likely include urinary loss of\\nanticlotting proteins, increased synthesis of clotting factors, or local activation of the glomerular\\nhemostasis system.\\nWhen immunosuppression is considered, the risk of therapy should always be weighed against the\\npotential benefit. Renal salvageability should be addressed, and patients with advanced disease on\\npresentation who are unlikely to benefit from such treatment may be better served by avoiding the risks of\\nhigh-dose immunosuppression. Cytotoxic agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) require close\\nmonitoring of WBC counts, checked at least weekly at the initiation of therapy. Dose adjustments may be\\nneeded to maintain the WBC count >3500 cells/μL. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against\\nCD20, has shown promise in a variety of immune-mediated disorders, including severe lupus nephritis\\n(LN), MN, and ANCA-positive vasculitis, where it has been given IV as four weekly doses of 375 mg/m2\\n(N Engl J Med 2010;363:221).\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

A form of interstitial nephritis associated with NSAID use may also be associated with MCD.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nThe kidney biopsy reveals normal glomeruli on light microscopy and negative immunofluorescence. Electron\\nmicroscopy shows effacement of the foot processes as the only histologic abnormality.\\nTREATMENT\\nIn adults, treatment with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d may induce remission (decrease in proteinuria) in\\n8-16 weeks. Once in remission, the steroids can be tapered over 3 months and then discontinued. The\\nurine protein excretion should be followed during this taper.\\nRelapse may occur in up to 75% of adults. Reinstitution of prednisone is often effective. If the patient is\\nsteroid dependent or steroid resistant, cytotoxic agents may be needed, with cyclophosphamide 2\\nmg/kg/d or chlorambucil 0.2 mg/kg/d. Cyclosporine 5 mg/kg/d is an alternative therapy. Rituximab may be\\nbeneficial in frequently relapsing or glucocorticoid-dependent MCD (Kidney Int 2013;83:511).\\nMembranous Nephropathy\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nMN usually presents with the nephrotic syndrome or heavy proteinuria, whereas renal function is often normal\\nor near normal. Disease progression is variable, with one-third remitting spontaneously, one-third progressing\\nto ESRD, and one-third with an intermediate course.\\nSecondary forms of MN are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; class V), viral hepatitis,\\nsyphilis, or solid organ malignancies.

Studies combining ACE inhibitors with an ARB or the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren\\nhave shown worse renal and cardiovascular outcomes ( N Engl J Med 2008;358:1547).\\nDeposition Disorders/Dysproteinemias\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nDysproteinemias include amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease (LCDD), heavy chain deposition\\ndisease (HCDD), fibrillary glomerulopathy, and immunotactoid glomerulopathy. Multiple myeloma may be\\nassociated with amyloidosis or LCDD. These disorders can affect the kidney in a variety of ways, including\\nglomerular or tubular deposition, formation of insoluble protein casts in the tubules (micro-obstructive cast\\nnephropathy), or through hypercalcemia and volume depletion. Glomerular deposition is typically associated with\\nheavy proteinuria due to overflow as well as disruption of filtration barrier integrity.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nDiagnosis is suggested by an abnormal monoclonal protein found in the SPEP, urine protein\\nelectrophoresis, or serum free light chains. Immunoglobulin (Ig) chains are not\\ndetected by routine urine dipstick and may be missed unless glomerular involvement has led to general\\nprotein leakage. Rarely, these tests are negative, and only tissue biopsy can make the diagnosis.\\nDiagnostic Procedures\\nBiopsy of the kidney can show characteristic deposits. For amyloidosis, this appears as Congo Red-\\npositive β-pleated fibrils of 10 nm in diameter under electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence can\\nidentify the specific Ig chains for LCDD (more likely to occur with kappa light chains) and HCDD.\\nFibrillary and immunotactoid deposits are Congo Red negative. The fibrils of fibrillary\\nglomerulopathy (12-20 nm) are typically thicker than those for amyloid, whereas the microtubules of\\nimmunotactoid glomerulopathy are even wider (20-60 nm) with a visible lumen in cross-section.\\nImmunotactoid glomerulonephropathy has a strong association with myelodysplastic disorders.\\nWhen cast nephropathy is implicated in a dysproteinemic disorder, the biopsy shows enlarged\\ntubules filled with proteinaceous material.

Chemotherapy aimed\\nat the underlying disease can be effective in reversing renal disease. When cast nephropathy is present on\\nbiopsy, a course of plasmapheresis in conjunction with treatment of the myeloma may stabilize renal\\nfunction. There is no specific treatment for fibrillary or immunotactoid glomerulopathy, although addressing\\nan underlying malignancy, if present, may slow progression in the latter.\\nMembranoproliferative Glomerulonephropathy\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nPrimary idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephropathy (MPGN) is uncommon. Hepatitis C accounts for\\nmost cases of secondary MPGN, frequently in association with cryoglobulinemia. Other secondary causes\\ninclude HIV, SLE, chronic infections, and various malignancies.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nMPGN can present with the nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome, or a combination of both. Classically,\\nthere are three defined subtypes of MPGN (I, II, and III). However, as the molecular basis for disease is\\nelucidated, an alternate classification has been proposed (N Engl J Med 2012;366:1119).\\nTypes I and III are mediated through immune complex formation.\\nType II MPGN (also called dense-deposit disease) and the related disorder C3 glomerulonephritis\\n(C3GN) depend on activation of the alternative complement pathway. Both C3 and C4 are usually low in\\nthe immune complex-mediated forms of MPGN, whereas only C3 is low in type II MPGN. The antibody C3\\nnephritic factor may be present in type II MPGN, stabilizing the C3-convertase and promoting complement\\nconsumption. Deficiencies of or antibodies against the complement regulators (factors H and I) may also\\nactivate the complement cascade.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nKidney biopsy shows mesangial proliferation and hypercellularity on light microscopy, with “lobulization” of\\nthe glomerular tuft. Accumulation of debris along the filtration barrier may lead to a damage-repair cycle that\\nresults in duplication of the GBM, giving a double-contour or “tram track” appearance on silver stain.\\nImmunofluorescence can show granular mesangial and capillary wall deposits of Ig in the immune complex-\\nmediated forms, whereas only the C3 staining is positive in type II MPGN or C3GN. Electron microscopy\\ncan show subendothelial (type I) or intramembranous (type II) deposits. Type III disease has subendothelial\\nand subepithelial deposits.\\nTREATMENT\\nIn adult idiopathic MPGN, treatment with immunosuppression has not shown a consistent benefit,\\nalthough this may have been a result of the lumping together of pathophysiologically dissimilar diseases\\nunder the older classification scheme.\\nTreatment of the secondary forms is targeted at the underlying disease.

Abnormally glycosylated IgA is thought to be responsible for immune complex\\nformation and mesangial deposition. Although serum IgA levels do not correlate with disease activity, events\\nthat potentially lead to overproduction (concurrent upper respiratory infection) or decreased clearance\\n(hepatic cirrhosis) may predispose to disease.\\nTREATMENT\\nAggressiveness of therapy depends on severity of disease. For patients with a benign course, conservative\\nmanagement with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) may prevent deterioration of renal\\nfunction, although the benefit of fish oil remains controversial.

Proteinuria may be present and is usually in the subnephrotic\\nrange.\\nIt is classically associated with streptococcal infection, which typically affects children under the age of 10\\nyears, after a latent period of 2-4 weeks from onset of pharyngitis or skin infection. However, bacterial\\nendocarditis, visceral abscesses, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections can also lead to this immune\\ncomplex-mediated disease.\\nLow complement levels are usually seen.

Typically, this results in rapidly progressive renal failure often with\\nconcurrent pulmonary involvement in the form of alveolar hemorrhage. A nephritic picture predominates, with\\ndysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts in the urine. Arthralgias and fever may represent other systemic\\nmanifestations.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nIn anti-GBM antibody disease, circulating antibody to the α-3 chain of type IV collagen is deposited in\\nthe basement membrane of alveoli and glomeruli, resulting in linear staining on immunofluorescence.\\nGoodpasture syndrome includes pulmonary involvement and can present with life-threatening alveolar\\nhemorrhage. The presence of anti-GBM antibody in the serum supports the diagnosis, and 10-30% of\\npatients will have a positive ANCA serology as well.\\nIn granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), vasculitic\\nlesions involve the small vessels of the kidneys and may also involve the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal\\ntract. As in anti-GBM antibody disease, pulmonary hemorrhage may be life threatening. Biopsy findings\\ninclude a small-vessel vasculitis with noncaseating granuloma formation in the kidneys, lungs, or sinuses.\\nGPA is part of a group of diseases known as pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (referring to the\\nabsence of immunostaining deposits), which includes Churg-Strauss syndrome (asthma and\\neosinophilia) and microscopic polyangiitis.\\nIn GPA, there is a positive cytoplasmic ANCA directed against serine proteinase-3, whereas in\\nmicroscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome, there is a positive perinuclear ANCA directed\\nagainst myeloperoxidase.\\nTREATMENT\\nIn anti-GBM antibody disease, the goal of therapy is to clear the pathogenic antibody while\\nsuppressing new production. Treatment is with daily total volume plasmapheresis for approximately 14\\ndays in conjunction with cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/d and glucocorticoids (IV methylprednisolone 7-15\\nmg/kg/d for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d). Immunosuppression is tapered over 8 weeks.\\nSerial measurement of the anti-GBM antibody level is useful to monitor therapy, with plasmapheresis and\\nimmunosuppression continuing until it is undetectable.\\nPoor response to therapy is predicted by the presence of oliguria, Cr >5.7 mg/dL, or dialysis dependence\\non presentation. Even if the likelihood of renal recovery is low, evidence of pulmonary involvement\\nwarrants aggressive therapy.\\nTreatment of GPA is with combined prednisone 1 mg/kg/d (with taper) and cyclophosphamide (IV at 1\\ng/m2 monthly or orally at 2 mg/kg/d) for at least 3 months to induce remission. Therapy should then\\ncontinue with oral steroids for 1 year to prevent relapse. More aggressive management with\\nplasmapheresis and pulse IV steroids may be beneficial for patients presenting with pulmonary\\nhemorrhage or dialysis dependence. Rituximab given IV as four weekly doses of 375 mg/m2, in\\ncombination with steroids, has also been approved for treatment of GPA (N Engl J Med 2010;363:221).\\nDouble-strength sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim given twice daily has been shown to reduce extrarenal\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

Approximately 20% of patients with\\nADPKD do not have a positive family history.\\nThere are two well-described mutations in the polycystin genes, PKD1 and PKD2. PKD1 is the most common\\nand present in approximately 85% of ADPKD. PKD2 is associated with a later onset of disease.\\nThe mechanism by which cysts form is unclear. The polycystin gene products primarily localize to the cilia of\\nthe tubular apical membrane. Disordered regulation of cell division may lead to overgrowth of the tubular\\nsegment, eventually pinching off from the rest of the collecting system. Cyst formation affects only a relatively\\nsmall percentage of tubules, suggesting a “two-hit” hypothesis where a sporadic mutation of the wild-type\\nallele results in local cystogenesis\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nHypertension is an early feature of ADPKD. As the affected tubules enlarge, they impinge upon the blood\\nflow to neighboring glomeruli, rendering them ischemic. This is turn activates the renin-angiotensin-\\naldosterone system, leading to systemic hypertension. Onset of kidney failure is highly variable, with half\\nof patients reaching ESRD by the age of 60.\\nCerebral aneurysms, hepatic cysts, mitral valve prolapse, and colonic diverticula are found in association\\nwith ADPKD. As cysts enlarge, they may result in a palpable flank mass. Gross hematuria and pain may\\nindicate cyst hemorrhage into the collecting system. Flank pain may also be caused by cyst infection or\\nstretching of the renal capsule.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nDifferentiation from other cystic diseases (acquired cystic disease, medullary sponge kidney, medullary\\ncystic kidney disease) can be made by the presence of enlarged cystic kidneys rather than shrunken or\\nnormal-sized cystic kidneys. Acquired cystic disease is often seen in patients with CKD as well as\\npatients on dialysis. The cysts are typically bilateral in atrophic kidneys.\\nUltrasonography reveals multiple cysts. In the setting of a positive family history, a diagnosis of ADPKD\\ncan be made from ultrasound findings, with criteria differing according to age. At least three cysts are\\nrequired in patients under the age of 40 years. In patients aged 40-59 years, at least two cysts in each\\nkidney are needed. For patients age 60 years and older, the diagnosis requires at least four cysts in each\\nkidney.\\nPatients with a family history of cerebral aneurysms or with symptoms attributable to a cerebral aneurysm\\nshould undergo evaluation with brain MRI/MRA.\\nGenetic testing may be considered if patients have equivocal imaging results or if a definitive diagnosis is\\nrequired.\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

Aggressive control\\nof hypertension should be practiced, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with an\\nACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended as firstline therapy.\\nGross hematuria from cyst hemorrhage can usually be managed with bed rest, hydration, and analgesia.\\nResolution may take 5-7 days.\\nCyst infections are generally treated with antibiotics that achieve good penetration into the cysts.\\nSulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin are the antibiotics of choice. The absence of bacterial\\ngrowth in the urine does not rule out infection because the cystic fluid does not necessarily communicate\\nwith the rest of the collecting system.\\nPain that persists without an obvious hemorrhagic or infectious cause may respond to cyst reduction\\nsurgery, particularly if there is a culprit cyst that can be identified and targeted.\\nAs the underlying mechanism for cyst growth is clarified, newer treatment options are emerging. Past\\ntrials investigating the antimetabolites sirolimus and everolimus have been disappointing. A large study of\\ntolvaptan in ADPKD showed a significant reduction in the cyst growth rate but with an uncertain benefit in\\nlong-term renal function coupled with signals of potential hepatotoxicity; formal approval awaits the\\nresults of further investigation (N Engl J Med 2012;367:2407).\\nNephrolithiasis\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nCalcium-based stones are the most common and appear predominantly as calcium oxalate or calcium\\nphosphate salts. These stones are radiopaque. Calcium phosphate stones can appear as elongated, blunt\\ncrystals and form in alkaline urine. Calcium oxalate stones can be found in acidic or alkaline urine and can be\\ndumbbell shaped or appear as paired pyramids (giving them an envelope appearance when viewed on end).\\nUric acid stones can be idiopathic or develop as part of hyperuricosuric states such as gout and\\nmyeloproliferative disorders. These stones are radiolucent and are found in acidic urine. Uric acid crystals\\nexhibit a variety of shapes, with needles and rhomboid forms being the most common.\\nStruvite stones contain magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate, and develop in alkaline urine associated\\nwith urea-splitting organisms (e.g., Proteus, Klebsiella). They are radiopaque and can extend to fill the renal\\npelvis, taking on a staghorn configuration. On microscopy, struvite crystals have a characteristic coffin-lid\\nshape.\\nCystine stones are uncommon and can form as the result of an autosomal recessive disorder. These stones\\nhave an intermediate radiolucency and appear as hexagonal crystals in the urine.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nPatients often present with costovertebral angle or flank pain, which can radiate to the scrotum or labia.\\nHematuria with nondysmorphic RBCs may be noted.

This collection should not be done during an\\nacute episode in a hospitalized patient but rather reserved for when the patient is on his or her usual\\noutpatient diet.\\nTREATMENT\\nGeneral treatment consists of hydration to increase urine output and analgesia. If the stone is\\nobstructing outflow or is accompanied by infection, removal is indicated with urgent urologic or radiologic\\nintervention.\\nAfter passage of a stone, treatment is directed at prevention of recurrent stone formation.\\nRegardless of stone type, the foundation of therapy is maintenance of high urine output (2-3 L/d) with\\noral hydration and a low-sodium diet (<2 g/d).\\nFor calcium oxalate stones, a low-calcium diet is no longer recommended given the risks of osteoporosis.\\nInstead, patients should be on a normal-calcium diet with no added calcium supplements. Oxalate-rich\\nfoods (e.g., spinach, rhubarb) should be avoided. Thiazide diuretics may reduce calciuria, and potassium\\ncitrate may be added in patients with hypocitraturia.\\nUric acid stones can be prevented or reduced in size by allopurinol or urinary alkalinization with citrate,\\nbicarbonate, or acetazolamide.

A prognostic\\nscale has been developed incorporating both the GFR and degree of albuminuria to predict the\\nlikelihood to renal failure (see Figure 13-1).\\nNephrotoxic agents, such as iodinated contrast agents and aminoglycosides, should be avoided when\\npossible. Careful attention to drug dosing is mandatory, frequently\\nguided by the estimated GFR or CKD stage. Drug levels should be monitored where appropriate.\\nPatients undergoing coronary angiography are at particular risk for worsening CKD.

Restriction to <2 g/d should\\nbe used if heart failure or refractory hypertension is present. A 24-hour urine sodium level of 100 mEq\\nroughly correlates with a 2 g/d diet.\\nFluid restriction is generally not required in CKD patients and, if excessive, may lead to volume\\ndepletion and hypernatremia. Restriction is appropriate in patients with dilutional hyponatremia.\\nPotassium should be restricted to 60 mEq/d in individuals with hyperkalemia. Tomato-based\\nproducts, bananas, potatoes, and citrus drinks are high in potassium and should be avoided in these\\npatients.\\nDietary phosphate restriction should be to 800-1000 mg/d. Dairy products, dark colas, and nuts\\nshould be avoided in hyperphosphatemia. Oral binders (calcium carbonate or acetate, lanthanum\\ncarbonate, sevelamer carbonate) can be used if dietary restrictions are unable to control phosphate\\nlevels.\\nHypertension\\nUncontrolled hypertension accelerates the rate of decline of renal function. Blood pressure control to\\n<140/90 mm Hg is recommended for patients with CKD (JAMA 2014;311:507).\\nACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used preferentially in the CKD population.

Thiazide diuretics\\nbecome less effective as the GFR falls below 30 mL/min, whereas loop diuretics retain their efficacy,\\nalthough higher doses may be required for the desired effect.\\nAnemia\\nA normocytic anemia is common in CKD and should be searched for once the GFR falls below 60\\nmL/min (stage 3).\\nAlternate causes for an anemia should be entertained in the appropriate setting and iron stores\\nassessed. If the transferrin saturation is <25% and there is no evidence of iron\\noverload (ferritin <1000 ng/mL), consideration should be given to iron repletion with 1 g of an IV\\npreparation of iron dextran (1000 mg once with test dose of 25 mg), ferric gluconate (125 mg, eight\\ndoses), or iron sucrose (100 mg, 10 doses).\\nErythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), such as epoetin and darbepoetin, can effectively reduce but\\ndo not prevent the need for RBC transfusions. ESA therapy increases the risk of stroke and thrombotic\\nand cardiovascular events and worsens outcomes in patients with cancer. These agents should not be\\nstarted in CKD unless the hemoglobin is <10 g/dL, other causes of anemia such as iron deficiency are\\naddressed, and reduction in transfusions is a goal. The minimum dose that maintains the hemoglobin\\nabove the need for transfusion and below 11 g/dL should be used. Correction of iron deficiency\\nfrequently decreases the ESA dose requirement and may defer the need for ESA. Targeting the\\nhemoglobin to higher levels has been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, and this risk\\nmay be related to the higher doses of ESA (N Engl J Med 2010;363:1146).\\nBone mineral disorders\\nCKD bone mineral disorders increase in prevalence as the GFR declines through stage 3 and more\\nadvanced disease. They include disorders of bone turnover and secondary hyperparathyroidism.\\nOsteitis fibrosa cystica is commonly associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased\\nbone turnover, resulting in bone pain and fractures. Adynamic bone disease is a low-turnover state\\nwith suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Osteomalacia can involve deposition of aluminum\\ninto bone and is less commonly seen today with the decreased use of aluminum-based phosphate\\nbinders.\\nIn CKD, starting in stage 3, vitamin D deficiency, low calcium, and elevated phosphate can all\\ncontribute to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The general goal of therapy is to suppress PTH\\ntoward normal while maintaining normal serum calcium and phosphate. This can be addressed in three\\nsteps: repletion of vitamin D stores (25-OH vitamin D), control of dietary phosphate with binders, and\\nadministration of active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or an analog).\\nDeficient stores (25-OH vitamin D <30 ng/mL) should be corrected with oral ergocalciferol 50,000-IU\\ncapsule weekly or every other week or cholecalciferol 2000-4000 IU daily. The duration of treatment\\ndepends on severity of the deficiency, with levels <5 ng/dL warranting at least 12 weeks of treatment.\\nOnce at goal, maintenance therapy can rely on either monthly ergocalciferol 50,000 IU or daily\\ncholecalciferol 1000-2000 IU.\\nPhosphate control can be difficult as GFR declines, even with appropriate dietary restriction.\\nPhosphate binders inhibit gastrointestinal absorption.

Lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate are\\nnon-calcium-based alternatives.\\nActive vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) and its synthetic analogs are potent suppressors of PTH\\nand can be administered if serum PTH remains elevated. Options include daily calcitriol (0.25-1 μg),\\nparicalcitol (1-5 μg), or doxercalciferol (1-5 μg). Calcium levels need to be monitored regularly and\\ndoses adjusted to avoid hypercalcemia.\\nCinacalcet is a calcimimetic that acts on the parathyroid gland to suppress PTH release. It should be\\nused only in dialysis patients and usually in conjunction with active vitamin D, because it may induce\\nsignificant hypocalcemia and is relatively ineffective as monotherapy.\\nMetabolic acidosis. As renal function deteriorates, the kidney is unable to appropriately excrete\\nsufficient acid, resulting in metabolic acidosis (mixed high and normal anion gap).\\nTo compensate, alkaline buffer is released from the skeleton but can ultimately worsen bone mineral\\ndisease.\\nTreatment with sodium bicarbonate 650-1300 mg thrice daily can help maintain the serum\\nbicarbonate level at 22 mEq/L. Such therapy, however, can increase the sodium load and contribute to\\nedema or hypertension.\\nCitrate, another alkaline source, should not be used in the CKD or ESRD population because it can\\ndramatically enhance gastrointestinal absorption of aluminum and lead to aluminum toxicity or\\nosteomalacia.\\nHyperlipidemia. Therapy with statins combined with ezetimibe has shown improved cardiovascular\\noutcomes with fewer major atherosclerotic events in patients with moderate to severe CKD and in the\\ndialysis population, although the benefit in patients on dialysis was less (Lancet 2011;377:2181). Use of\\nlipid-lowering therapy is appropriate in patients with atherosclerotic disease at all stages of CKD.\\nPreparation for renal replacement therapy\\nPatients should be counseled at an early stage to determine preferences for renal replacement\\ntherapies, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis (PD), and eligibility for renal transplantation.\\nIn stage 4 CKD, preparation for the creation of a permanent vascular access for hemodialysis should\\nbe initiated by protecting the nondominant forearm from IV catheters and blood draws.

Uremic encephalopathy or pericarditis, as well as certain\\nintoxications (methanol, ethylene glycol, or salicylates), can all be indications to initiate dialytic\\ntherapy acutely. In the chronic setting, renal replacement therapy is typically begun prior to the\\nworsening of the metabolic or nutritional status of the patient.\\nDialysis works by solute diffusion and water transport across a selectively permeable membrane. In\\nhemodialysis, blood is pumped counter-currently to a dialysis solution within an extracorporeal\\nmembrane. This can be performed intermittently (3-4 hours during the day) or in a continuous 24-hour\\nfashion depending on hemodynamic stability or goals of therapy. PD uses the patient's peritoneal\\nmembrane as the selective filter, and dialysis fluid is instilled into the peritoneal cavity.\\nTransplantation offers the best long-term survival and most completely replaces the filtrative and\\nendocrine functions of the native kidney. However, it carries the risks that accompany long-term\\nimmunosuppression.\\nDiffusion\\nThe selectively permeable membrane contains pores that allow electrolytes and other small molecules to\\npass by diffusion while holding back larger molecules and cellular components of the blood. Movement\\nrelies on the molecular size and the concentration gradient, where Cr, urea, potassium, and other waste\\nproducts of metabolism pass into the dialysis solution while alkaline buffers (bicarbonate or lactate) enter\\nthe blood from the dialysis solution.\\nUltrafiltration/convection\\nRemoval of water is termed ultrafiltration (UF). It can be achieved in hemodialysis via a transmembrane\\nhydrostatic pressure that removes excess fluid from the blood compartment. In PD, water follows its\\nosmotic gradient into the relatively hyperosmolar dialysis solution (usually with dextrose providing the\\nosmotic driving force).\\nAs water is removed from the vascular compartment, it drags along solute. This is termed convective\\nclearance. This usually accounts for only a small fraction of the total clearance but can be significantly\\nincreased if a physiologic “replacement fluid” is infused into the patient concurrently to prevent\\nhypovolemia. This strategy is frequently employed by continuous hemodialysis modalities (see the\\nfollowing text).\\nHemodialysis\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nHemodialysis is by far the most commonly used form of renal replacement therapy in the United States.\\nIntermittent hemodialysis (IHD) typically runs for 3-4 hours per session and is performed three times weekly.\\nOutpatient, in-center hemodialysis for ESRD generally uses this modality, although variations are available for\\npatients undergoing home treatments.\\nContinuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used in specialized circumstances, particularly when\\nthe patient's hemodynamic status would not tolerate the rapid fluid shifts of IHD. Although less efficient (with\\nslower blood flows) and using slower UF rates, CRRT can achieve equivalent clearances of both solute and\\nfluid compared to IHD due to its continuous, 24-hour nature. The slower blood flows usually necessitate\\nanticoagulation (with systemic heparin or regional citrate) to prevent the filter from clotting. Continuous\\nmodalities require specialized nursing and an intensive care setting.\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com\"),\n",

Intermediate blood flows lower the clotting risk if anticoagulation is not used, while intermediate\\ntreatment lengths (8-10 hours) still allow for adequate clearances. Patients also spend a significant portion of\\nthe day off the machine to allow for nonbedside testing, procedures, and physical therapy.\\nPrescription and adequacy\\nIHD typically runs for 3-4 hours and can ultrafilter 3-4 L safely in hemodynamically stable patients. In the\\nchronic setting, IHD is generally performed three times weekly, although the longer interdialytic interval on\\nthe weekend has been associated with a heightened mortality risk (N Engl J Med 2011;365:1099). In the\\nacute setting, the appropriate interval is not clearly known, although a thrice-weekly schedule is likely\\nadequate; daily assessment should be performed to reevaluate dialytic needs.\\nAdequacy is assessed by calculating the clearance of BUN, which serves as a surrogate marker of the\\n“uremic factors.” The urea reduction ratio (URR) can be calculated by the following:\\nURR = [(predialysis BUN - postdialysis BUN) / (predialysis BUN)] × 100\\nA reduction rate of >65% is considered adequate in the chronic setting (N Engl J Med 2002;347:2010). An\\nadequacy target is less well defined for AKI.\\nIntensive daily hemodialysis was not shown to be superior to standard thrice-weekly treatments (N Engl J\\nMed 2008;359:7).\\nClearance is measured differently in CRRT where dialytic therapy is taking place around the clock,\\neffectively serving as an extracorporeal “GFR.” Drug dosing needs to be adjusted accordingly. An estimate\\nof this clearance can be calculated by the sum of the dialysis fluid and replacement fluid, and net UF rates\\nare expressed as the number of milliliters per minute. For most circumstances, this approximates a\\nclearance of 20-50 mL/min.\\nWith CRRT, the net UF rate can be adjusted as needed, according to the patient's hemodynamic status.\\nOne must be vigilant in checking electrolyte levels (particularly ionized calcium and phosphorus) to ensure\\nthey remain within the desired ranges. Calcium levels are especially important to follow when regional\\ncitrate anticoagulation is being used.\\nPhosphate, which is predominantly intracellular, is generally poorly removed by IHD; however, in CRRT,\\nthere is continuous efflux of this anion, and significant hypophosphatemia can occur.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nNontunneled catheters are typically placed in the internal jugular or femoral vein and carry the same risks\\nas other central venous catheters (infection, bleeding, pneumothorax). They are almost exclusively used\\nin the inpatient setting and are generally used for 1-2 weeks. Tunneled catheters have lower rates of\\ninfection and can be used for 6 months while a more definitive access is maturing (AV fistula or graft).\\nFevers and rigors, particularly during dialysis, should prompt a search for an infectious cause, and\\nempiric antibiotic coverage for staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria should be administered.\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com\"),\n",

Infectious causes should be sought in the appropriate\\nsetting. Acute treatment of the drop in blood pressure includes infusion of normal saline (as 200-mL\\nboluses) and reduction of the UF rate.\\nDialysis disequilibrium is an uncommon syndrome that may occur in severely uremic patients undergoing\\ntheir first few treatments. Rapid clearance of toxins is thought to induce cerebral edema by osmolar shifts\\nand can present as nausea, emesis, headache, confusion, or seizures. Occurrence can be prevented or\\nameliorated by initiating patients on dialysis with slower blood flows and shorter treatments.\\nPeritoneal Dialysis\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nHistorically, PD has been used in the acute setting for hemodynamically unstable patients. However, with the\\ndevelopment and availability of safe and effective continuous hemodialysis, use of PD in the treatment of AKI\\nin adults has been mostly abandoned in the United States. Currently, its use is primarily in the treatment of\\nESRD.\\nThere are two modalities in use: manual exchanges and automated cycler exchanges.\\nThe manual modality, also called continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), has the patient instill\\ndialysis fluid into the peritoneum for a specified length of time, after which the dialysate is drained and\\nreplaced by another dwell.\\nThe automated modality, also called continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), typically operates\\novernight where a machine runs a preprogrammed set of exchanges while the patient sleeps. A final fill\\nusually remains in the peritoneum and is carried during the daytime for continued solute exchange.\\nBoth PD modalities require strict adherence to sterile technique, and careful patient selection is necessary.\\nGenerally, PD should not be used if there is a history of recent abdominal surgery or if multiple peritoneal\\nadhesions are present.\\nPrescription and adequacy\\nThe choice between CAPD and CCPD usually depends on patient preference and on the transport\\ncharacteristics of the peritoneal membrane. Manual exchanges (i.e., CAPD) can be used as a backup\\nmodality, particularly in the hospital where nurse staffing or machine availability may be limited.\\nIn writing PD orders, the following variables must be specified: dwell volume, dwell time, number of\\nexchanges, and dextrose concentration of the dialysis solution. The dwell volume is typically between 2-3 L.\\nThe dextrose concentration can be 1.50%, 2.50%, or 4.25%, providing the osmotic gradient for fluid\\nremoval. Higher dextrose concentrations allow for greater UF but also lead to more glucose absorption and\\nworsening control of diabetes. Icodextrin is a glucose polymer preparation that can be used in longer dwell\\nbecause it is minimally absorbed and thus maintains an effective osmotic gradient up to 18 hours.\\nhttp://internalmedicinebook.com'),\n",

A sample order set for manual\\nCAPD would be 2.5 L, four exchanges, 6 hours each, with 2.5% dextrose.\\nPD is less efficient than conventional hemodialysis. However, given its continuous nature, solute clearance\\nand UF can approximate that of other modalities. Larger volumes and more frequent exchanges can assist\\nwith solute exchange. Increasing the concentration of dextrose can promote greater UF in volume-\\noverloaded patients.\\nResidual renal function is very important in the PD population, and avoidance of nephrotoxins should be\\npracticed (J Am Soc Nephrol 2002;13:1307).\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nPeritonitis typically presents with diffuse abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal fluid. A sample should be\\nsent for cell count, differential, Gram stain, and culture. A WBC count of >100 cells/μL, of which at least\\n50% are neutrophils, supports the diagnosis.\\nEmpiric therapy should cover for both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with a first-\\ngeneration cephalosporin (cefazolin or cephalothin) and ceftazidime at 15-20 mg/kg of each in the\\nlongest dwell of the day (Perit Dial Int 2005;25:107). If a methicillin-resistant organism is suspected,\\nuse vancomycin (30 mg/kg every 5-7 days) for gram-positive coverage and a third-generation\\ncephalosporin for gram-negative coverage, including Pseudomonas.\\nThe intraperitoneal route is the preferred method of administration, unless the patient is overtly septic,\\nin which case IV antibiotics should be used. Antibiotics can be tailored once culture results are known\\nand should be continued for 2-3 weeks. Multiple organisms, particularly if gram negative, should\\nprompt a search for intestinal perforation.\\nTunnel or exit site infections may present with local erythema, tenderness, or purulent drainage, although\\ncrusting at the exit site alone does not necessarily indicate infection. Treatment can be with oral\\ncephalosporins (gram positive) or fluoroquinolones (gram\\nnegative). However, infections can be difficult to eradicate, and catheter removal may be required with a\\ntemporary transition to hemodialysis.\\nFailure of PD fluid to drain is termed outflow failure. This may result from kinking of the catheter,\\nconstipation, or plugging of the catheter with fibrin strands. Conservative treatment should aim at\\nresolving constipation if present and instilling heparin into the PD fluid at 500 units/L.\\nSmall hernias are at particularly high risk for incarceration and should be corrected surgically while the\\npatient is temporarily treated with hemodialysis. Fluid leaks can lead to abdominal wall and genital edema\\nand typically result from anatomic defects. Hydrothorax usually occurs on the right side and can be\\ndiagnosed by a markedly elevated glucose concentration in the pleural fluid. Pleurodesis can eliminate\\nthe potential space and permit continuation of PD.\\nSclerosing encapsulating peritonitis is a complication of long-term PD. The peritoneal membrane\\nbecomes thickened and entraps loops of bowel, leading to symptoms of bowel obstruction. A bloody\\ndrainage may be present. Treatment is supportive with the focus on bowel rest and surgical lysis of\\nadhesions. A trial of immunosuppression with prednisone 10-40 mg/d may have limited benefit.\\nHyperglycemia results from the systemic absorption of glucose from the dialysis fluid.

Infection is often polymicrobial, with viridans streptococci, \\nS. aureus\\n, and\\nanaerobes being the most common pathogens; staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli predominate after\\nsurgery.

When no\\npreceding infection can be found, a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) combined with\\nmetronidazole and vancomycin is a reasonable regimen in immunocompetent hosts until culture data are\\navailable. Cefepime or ceftazidime should be substituted for ceftriaxone after neurosurgical procedures or\\nwith penetrating head trauma.\\nNeurosurgical consultation is imperative for drainage; cultures must be sent to enable pathogen-directed\\ntherapy.

In the United States, cases\\nfell to 3.0 per 100,000 in 2013. Most US cases occur in foreign-born individuals and result from reactivation of\\nprior infection (\\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2014;63:229\\n).

Persons at highest risk for progression include those with impaired\\nimmunity, such as HIV infection, silicosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, malignancy,\\nmalnutrition, and immunosuppressive medications, including therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\\nantagonists (\\nAnn Rheum Dis 2013; 72:37\\n).\\nLatent TB infection (LTBI) occurs when someone has been exposed to TB but has no signs, symptoms, or\\nradiographic evidence of current active disease. Untreated, approximately 5% of persons with LTBI develop\\nactive TB disease within 2 years of infection. TB disease develops in an additional 5% of persons with LTBI\\nover their remaining life span. Adequate treatment of LTBI can substantially reduce the risk of disease (\\nAm J\\nRespir Crit Care Med 2014;190:1044\\n).\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nThe most frequent clinical presentation is pulmonary disease. Symptoms are often indolent and may\\ninclude cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, weight loss, or fatigue.

Ascending cholangitis presents as the \\nCharcot triad\\nof fever, RUQ pain, and jaundice. \\nReynolds pentad\\n adds symptoms of confusion and hypotension and\\nwarrants rapid intervention. Bacteremia and shock are common.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nLiver function test (LFT) abnormalities are often severe.\\nDiagnosis of biliary tract infections is usually made by imaging, with ultrasonography being the primary\\nmodality. Technetium-99m-hydroxy iminodiacetic acid scanning and CT scanning may also be useful (\\nN\\nEngl J Med 2008;358(26):2804\\n).\\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for diagnosis as well as therapeutic\\nintervention in the case of common bile duct obstruction and should be considered in patients with\\ncommon bile duct dilation, jaundice, or LFT abnormalities.\\nTREATMENT\\nManagement of \\nacute cholecystitis\\n includes parenteral fluids, restricted PO intake, analgesia, and\\nsurgery. Advanced age, severe disease, or complications such as gallbladder ischemia or perforation,\\nperitonitis, or bacteremia mandate broad-spectrum antibiotics (see \\nTable 14-8\\n). Immediate surgery is\\nusually necessary for severe disease, but surgery may be delayed up to 6 weeks if there is an initial\\nresponse to medical therapy (\\n Br J Surg 2010;97(2):141-50\\n). After cholecystectomy, perioperative\\nantibiotics may be discontinued (\\n JAMA 2014;312(2):145-54\\n).\\nThe mainstay of therapy for \\nascending cholangitis\\n is aggressive supportive care, including broad-'),\n",

Serious complications, such as candidemia leading to skin lesions, ocular\\ndisease, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis, can occur.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nDiagnosis of \\nmucocutaneous candidiasis\\n is usually based on clinical findings but can be confirmed by a\\npotassium hydroxide preparation of exudates. Cultures can be obtained in refractory cases to exclude the\\npresence of non-\\nCandida albicans\\n species. \\nInvasive candidiasis\\n is diagnosed by positive cultures of\\nblood or tissue.\\nTREATMENT\\nSee \\nTable 14-11\\n.\\nAlso see the \\nCatheter-Related Bloodstream Infections section under Health Care-Associated Infections\\n.\\nCryptococcosis\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nCryptococcus neoformans\\n is a ubiquitous yeast associated with soil and pigeon excrement. Disease is principally\\nmeningeal (headache and mental status changes) and pulmonary (ranging from asymptomatic nodular disease\\nto fulminant respiratory failure). Skin lesions can also be seen. Significant infections are usually opportunistic.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nDiagnosis requires detection of encapsulated yeast in tissue or body fluids (India ink stain) with confirmation\\nby culture. The latex agglutination test for cryptococcal antigen in serum or CSF is helpful, and a positive\\nserum antigen titer is highly suggestive of disseminated disease. Lumbar puncture is necessary in persons\\nwith systemic disease to exclude coexistent CNS involvement.

It is usually self-limiting.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical presentation usually consists of a few papulopustular lesions appearing 3-30 days after a cat bite or\\nscratch, followed by regional lymphadenitis (usually cervical or axillary) and mild constitutional symptoms.\\nAtypical presentations include oculoglandular disease, encephalopathy, arthritis, FUO, and culture-negative\\nendocarditis. Diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes of lymphadenitis and by detection of\\nantibodies to \\nB. henselae\\n or PCR of infected tissue, skin, or pus.\\nTREATMENT\\nLocalized disease spontaneously resolves in 2-4 months without treatment. If antimicrobial therapy is\\nprescribed, azithromycin 500 mg PO single dose followed by 250 mg PO for 4 more days is recommended.\\nNeedle aspiration of suppurative lymph nodes may provide symptomatic relief. Culture-negative\\nendocarditis has been discussed in the Cardiovascular Infections section (\\nClin Infect Dis 2005;41:1373\\n).\\nLeptospirosis\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nLeptospirosis is an acute febrile illness with varying presentations caused by \\nLeptospira interrogans\\n, a\\nubiquitous pathogen of wild and domestic mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Symptom onset is 5-14 days\\nafter contact with infected animals or water contaminated with their urine.\\nAnicteric leptospirosis\\n, which accounts for most cases, is a biphasic illness that starts with influenza-like\\nsymptoms and proceeds to conjunctival suffusion and aseptic meningitis after a brief defervescent period.\\nA minority of cases progress directly to \\nWeil disease (icteric leptospirosis)\\n, with multiorgan failure\\nmanifested by severe jaundice, uremia, and hemorrhagic pneumonitis.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by specific cultures of urine or blood, PCR, or paired serologic studies.\\nTREATMENT\\nTherapy for anicteric disease, which can shorten the duration of illness, is doxycycline 100 mg PO bid or\\namoxicillin 500 mg PO q6h for 7 days. Penicillin G 1.5 million units IV q4-6h or a third-generation\\ncephalosporin is used for treatment of severe disease, during which a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is\\npossible (\\nClin Microbiol Rev 2001;14:296\\n).\\nBrucellosis\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nBrucellosis is a protean systemic infection caused by members of the \\nBrucella\\n genus of gram-negative'),\n",

Fever can be spiking and accompanied by rigors but can also be relapsing and protracted.\\nMalodorous perspiration is almost pathognomonic. Physical exam may be nonrevealing, although\\nlymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly may be present. Complications within every organ\\nsystem can occur (e.g., diarrhea, arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, hepatitis).\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by isolation of the organism from blood or tissue culture. Serology may also be used,\\nbut cross-reactivity may exist with other bacteria.\\nTREATMENT\\nAntimicrobial treatment is doxycycline 100 mg PO bid for 6 weeks with streptomycin 15 mg/kg IM for 2-3\\nweeks.

Most wounds should not be sutured unless they are on the\\nface and have been thoroughly irrigated. Wound elevation should be encouraged.\\nTREATMENT\\nAntimicrobial therapy is given to treat overt infection and as prophylaxis for high-risk bite wounds based\\non severity (e.g., moderate to severe), location (e.g., hands, genitalia, near joints), bite source (e.g.,\\ncats), immune status (e.g., diabetes mellitus, asplenia, immunosuppression), and type of injury (e.g.,\\npuncture, crush injury). Tetanus toxoid should be administered if the patient has been previously\\nvaccinated but has not received a booster in the last 5 years.\\nProphylactic antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg PO bid for 3-5 days should\\nusually be administered, unless the bite is trivial.

Dog bites comprise 80% of animal bites, but only 5% of such bites become\\ninfected. For infected dog bite wounds, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or clindamycin plus ciprofloxacin, is\\neffective.\\nCat bites:\\n Normal oral flora includes \\nP. multocida\\n and \\nS. aureus\\n. Because more than 80% of cat bites\\nbecome infected, prophylaxis with amoxicillin-clavulanate should be routinely provided. Cephalosporins\\nshould not be used. Bartonellosis can also develop after a cat bite.\\nWild animal bites:\\n The need for rabies vaccination should be determined (see the following text). For\\nmost animal bites, amoxicillin-clavulanate is a good choice for prophylaxis and empiric treatment. Monkey\\nbites should be treated with acyclovir because of the risk of \\nHerpesvirus simiae\\n (B virus).\\nRabies\\nRabies causes an invariably fatal neurologic disease classically manifesting with hydrophobia,\\naerophobia, pharyngeal spasm, seizures, and coma.\\nThe need for rabies vaccination and immunoglobulin prophylaxis (see \\nAppendix A, Immunizations and\\nPostexposure Therapies\\n) should be determined after any animal bite. Risk of rabies depends on the\\nanimal species and geographic location. In the United States, most recent indigenous cases have\\nbeen associated with bats, whereas dog bites account for the vast majority of human cases in the\\ndeveloping world.\\nRegardless of species, if the animal is rabid or suspected to be rabid, the human diploid vaccine and\\nrabies immunoglobulin should be administered immediately. Bites by domestic animals rarely require\\nprophylaxis unless the condition of the animal is unknown. Public health authorities should be\\nconsulted to determine whether prophylaxis is recommended for other types of animal bites.\\nA single case of survival after symptom onset using an aggressive coma-inducing regimen has been\\nreported (\\nN Engl J Med 2005;352:2508\\n).\\nHuman Bites\\nHuman bites, particularly clenched-fist injuries, are prone to infection and other complications. The normal oral\\nflora of humans includes viridans streptococci, staphylococci, \\nBacteroides\\n spp., \\nFusobacterium\\n spp.,\\npeptostreptococci, and \\nEikenella corrodens\\n.\\nProphylaxis\\n with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg PO bid for 5 days is recommended for uninfected\\nwounds.\\nInfected wounds may require \\nparenteral therapy\\n, such as ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5 g IV q6h, cefoxitin 2 g IV\\nq8h, or ticarcillin-clavulanate 3.1 g IV q6h for 1-2 weeks. Therapy should be extended to 4-6 weeks if\\nosteomyelitis is present.\\nHEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS\\nHealth care-associated infections (HAIs) substantially contribute to morbidity, mortality, and excess health care\\ncosts.

Inhalational botulism could result from an intentional release of\\naerosolized toxin.\\nMortality is low when botulism is recognized early but may be very high in the setting of mass exposure and\\nlimited access to mechanical ventilation equipment.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nThe classic triad consists of an absence of fever, clear sensorium, and symmetric descending flaccid\\nparalysis with cranial nerve involvement, beginning with ptosis, diplopia, and dysarthria, and progressing\\nto loss of gag reflex and diaphragmatic function with respiratory failure, followed by diffuse skeletal\\nmuscle paralysis. Sensation remains intact. Paralysis can last from weeks to months.\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by detection of toxin in serum. Notify local infection control and public health\\ndepartments.\\nTREATMENT\\nTreatment is primarily supportive and may require mechanical ventilation in the setting of respiratory\\nfailure. Wound botulism requires extensive surgical debridement.\\nFurther progression of paralysis can be halted by early administration of botulinum antitoxin, available\\nthrough the state public health department or the CDC. Antitoxin is reserved only for cases where there is\\na high suspicion for botulism based on clinical presentation and exposure history. Routine postexposure\\nprophylaxis with antitoxin is not recommended because of the high incidence (10%) of hypersensitivity\\nreactions and limited supply.\\nViral Hemorrhagic Fever\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nThis syndrome is caused by many different RNA viruses, including filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg),\\nflaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever [CCHF],\\nRift Valley fever [RVF]), and arenaviruses (South American hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever).\\nAll of these viruses cause sporadic disease in endemic areas, and most can be transmitted as an aerosol or\\ncontact with infected body fluids.

A drug concentration is obtained 6-14 hours after the first dose, and a\\nnomogram (\\nFigure 15-1\\n) is consulted to determine the subsequent dosing interval. Monitoring includes\\nobtaining a drug concentration 6-14 hours after the dosage at least every week and a serum creatinine at\\nleast three times a week. In patients who are not responding to therapy, a 12-hour concentration should\\nbe checked, and if that concentration is undetectable, extended-interval dosing should be abandoned in\\nfavor of traditional dosing.\\nFor \\nobese patients\\n (actual weight >20% above ideal body weight [IBW]), an obese dosing weight (IBW\\n+ 0.4 × [actual body weight − IBW]) should be used for determining doses for both traditional and\\nextended-interval methods. Traditional dosing, rather than extended-interval dosing, should be used for\\npatients with endocarditis, burns that cover more than 20% of the body, anasarca, and creatinine\\nclearance (CrCl) of <30 mL/min.\\nGentamicin and tobramycin\\n traditional dosing is administered with an initial loading dose of 2 mg/kg IV\\n(2-3 mg/kg in the critically ill), followed by 1.0-1.7 mg/kg IV q8h (peak, 4-10 μg/mL; trough, <1-2 μg/mL).\\nExtended-interval dosing is administered with an initial loading dose of 5 mg/kg, with the subsequent\\ndosing interval determined by a nomogram (see \\nFigure 15-1\\n).

Whether tedizolid is less prone to\\nadverse effects characteristic of linezolid, such as\\nhematologic disturbances and peripheral and optic neuropathy, if used beyond 6 days, is uncertain.\\nTedizolid phosphate appears less likely to inhibit monoamine oxidase as compared to linezolid; however,\\npatients on serotonergic agents were excluded from tedizolid phase III acute bacterial skin and skin\\nstructure infection clinical trials.\\nMetronidazole\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nMetronidazole (250-750 mg PO/IV q6-12h) is only active against anaerobic bacteria and some protozoa. The\\ndrug exerts its bactericidal effect through accumulation of toxic metabolites that interfere with multiple biologic\\nprocesses. It has excellent tissue penetration, including abscess cavities, bone, and the CNS.\\nIt has greater activity against gram-negative than gram-positive anaerobes but is active against \\nClostridium\\nperfringens\\n and \\nC. difficile\\n. It is the treatment of choice as monotherapy for mild to moderate \\nC. difficile\\n colitis\\nas well as bacterial vaginosis and can be used in combination with other antibiotics to treat intra-abdominal\\ninfections and brain abscesses. Protozoal infections that are routinely treated with metronidazole include\\nGiardia\\n, \\nEntamoeba histolytica\\n, and \\nTrichomonas vaginalis\\n. A dose reduction may be warranted for patients\\nwith decompensated liver disease.\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nAdverse events\\n include nausea, dysgeusia, disulfiram-like reactions to alcohol, and mild CNS\\ndisturbances (headache, restlessness). Rarely, metronidazole causes peripheral neuropathy and seizures.\\nNitrofurantoin\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nNitrofurantoin\\n (50-100 mg PO macrocrystals q6h or 100 mg PO dual-release formulation q12h for 5-7 days)'),\n",

It has had a modest resurgence in use, as it is frequently effective for uncomplicated VRE\\nUTIs.\\nAlthough it was commonly used in the past for UTI prophylaxis, this practice should be avoided, because\\nprolonged therapy is associated with chronic pulmonary syndromes that can be fatal. Nitrofurantoin should not\\nbe used for pyelonephritis or any other systemic infections and should be avoided in patients with renal\\ndysfunction.\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nAdverse events:\\n Nausea is the most common adverse effect, and the drug should be taken with food to\\nminimize this problem. Patients should be warned that their urine may become brown secondary to the\\nmedication.

Telavancin is broadly active against gram-positive bacteria,\\nincluding MRSA, VISA, heteroresistant VISA (hVISA), daptomycin- and linezolid-resistant \\nS. aureus\\n, streptococci,\\nvancomycin-sensitive enterococci, and some gram-positive anaerobes. The agent is not active against gram-\\nnegative bacteria, vancomycin-resistant \\nS. aureus\\n, and VRE.\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nAdverse events\\n include nausea, vomiting, metallic or soapy taste, foamy urine, and nephrotoxicity (which\\nnecessitates serial monitoring of serum creatinine). Prehydration with normal saline may mitigate the\\nnephrotoxicity observed with the use of this drug. Telavancin can also cause a minor prolongation of the\\nQT\\nc\\n interval. Women of childbearing potential require a negative serum pregnancy test prior to receiving\\ntelavancin due to teratogenic effects noted in animals.\\nTigecycline\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nTigecycline\\n (100 mg IV loading dose, then 50 mg IV q12h) is the only FDA-approved antibiotic in the class of\\nglycylcyclines. Its mechanism of action is similar to that of tetracyclines by inhibiting the translation of bacterial\\nproteins through binding to the 30S ribosome. The addition of the glycyl side chain expands its activity against\\nbacterial pathogens that are normally resistant to tetracycline and minocycline. It has a broad spectrum of\\nbactericidal activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria except \\nP. aeruginosa\\n and\\nsome \\nProteus\\n isolates. It is currently FDA approved for treatment of complicated skin and skin structure\\ninfections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. Additionally, it may be\\nused for treatment of some other tissue infections due to susceptible strains of VRE and some multidrug-resistant\\ngram-negative bacteria. Due to low achievable blood concentrations, tigecycline should not be used to treat\\nprimary bacteremia.\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nAdverse events:\\n Nausea and vomiting are the most common adverse events. Tigecycline has not been\\nstudied in patients younger than 18 years and is contraindicated in pregnant and lactating women. Because\\nit has a similar structure to tetracyclines, photosensitivity, tooth discoloration, and, rarely, pseudotumor\\ncerebri may occur.

INH is a component of nearly all treatment regimens\\nand can be given twice a week in directly observed therapy (15 mg/kg/dose; 900 mg maximum). INH remains the\\ndrug of choice for treatment of latent TB infection (300 mg PO q24h for 9 months).\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nAdverse events\\n include elevations in liver transaminases (20%). This effect can be idiosyncratic but is\\nusually seen in the setting of advanced age, underlying liver disease, or concomitant consumption of\\nalcohol, and may be potentiated by rifampin. Transaminase elevations to greater than threefold the upper\\nlimit of the normal range necessitate holding therapy. Patients with known liver dysfunction should have\\nweekly LFTs during the initial stage of therapy. INH also antagonizes vitamin B\\n6\\n metabolism and potentially\\ncan cause a peripheral neuropathy. This can be avoided or minimized by coadministration of pyridoxine, 25-\\n50 mg PO daily, especially in the elderly, in pregnant women, and in patients with diabetes, renal failure,\\nalcoholism, and seizure disorders.\\nRifamycins\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nRifamycins exert bactericidal activity on susceptible mycobacteria by inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase,\\nthereby halting transcription.\\nRifampin\\n (600 mg PO q24h or twice a week) is an integral component of most TB treatment regimens. It is\\nalso active against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Rifampin is used as adjunctive therapy in\\nstaphylococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis (300 mg PO q8h), for prophylaxis of close contacts of patients\\nwith infection caused by \\nNeisseria meningitidis\\n (600 mg PO q12h), and as adjunctive treatment of bone and\\njoint infections associated with prosthetic material or devices. The drug is well absorbed orally and is widely\\ndistributed throughout the body including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\\nRifabutin\\n (300 mg PO q24h) is primarily used to treat TB and MAC infections in HIV-positive patients who are\\nreceiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, because it has fewer drug-drug interactions and less deleterious\\neffects on protease inhibitor metabolism than does rifampin (see \\nChapter 16, Sexually Transmitted Infections,\\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\\n).\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nAdverse events:\\n Patients should be warned about reddish-orange discoloration of body fluids, and\\ncontact lenses should not be worn during treatment.

By the most recent estimates, over 34 million people worldwide\\nare living with HIV or AIDS, with a significant burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa\\n(\\nhttp://www.who.int/hiv/data/en/index.html\\n).\\nIn the United States, 1.3 million people are estimated to be infected with HIV with one-fifth of these people\\nunaware of their infection. The CDC estimates that as many as 70% of the 50,000 new annual infections in\\nthe United States are transmitted by persons who are unaware of their HIV status.\\nDespite comprising only 14% of the population in the United States, African Americans account for nearly 44%\\nof all new cases of HIV in this country. Hispanics are also disproportionately affected by HIV. Women comprise\\napproximately 24% of the US epidemic (\\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/women\\n).\\nMSM remain the population most heavily affected by HIV in the United States.

It is characterized by much slower progression to AIDS and\\nresistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).\\nPathophysiology\\nAfter entering the host cell, viral RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA using the HIV \\nreverse\\ntranscriptase\\n. This viral DNA is inserted into the host genome through the activity of the viral \\nintegrase\\n.\\nThe host cell machinery is then used to produce the relevant viral proteins, which are appropriately\\ntruncated by a viral \\nprotease\\n. Infectious viral particles bud away to infect other CD4 lymphocytes.\\nMost infected cells are killed by the host CD8 T-cell response.\\nLong-lived latently infected cells persist, especially memory T cells.\\nInfection usually leads to CD4 T-cell depletion and \\nimpaired cell-mediated immunity\\n over a period of\\n8-10 years.\\nWithout treatment, >90% of infected patients will progress to AIDS, which is characterized by the\\ndevelopment of opportunistic infections (OIs), wasting, and viral-associated malignancies.\\nRisk Factors\\nThe virus is primarily transmitted sexually but also via parenteral and perinatal exposure.\\nThe highest risk of transmission is through blood transfusions (9250 per 10,000 exposures). Sharing needles\\nor needlestick injuries result in transmission in 50 per 10,000 exposures.\\nAmong sexual practices, unprotected anal receptive intercourse carries the highest risk of transmission (138\\nper 10,000 exposures), followed by insertive anal intercourse, vaginal receptive intercourse, and vaginal\\ninsertive intercourse. Oral intercourse carries a lower risk of transmission.\\nPrevention\\nHIV transmission can be prevented by safe sex practices, which include condom use (male or female) for\\nvaginal, oral, and anal intercourse, decreasing the number of sexual partners, and avoiding needle\\nsharing.\\nPostexposure prophylaxis (PEP), or the provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) after needlestick injury\\nor high-risk sexual exposure, can prevent infection.\\nPreexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), or continuous ART in HIV-negative patients, has proven to decrease the\\nrate of HIV transmission.

The p24 antigen is a viral capsid protein that can be detected as early as\\n4-10 days from acute infection, up to 2 weeks earlier than the antibody tests alone. An eclipse phase of\\ninfection, during which no testing is positive, still exists for up to 7 days after exposure.\\nIf the fourth-generation assay is positive, then a differentiation test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies is\\nperformed.\\nIf the HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody differentiation test is negative for both HIV-1 and HIV-2, then nucleic acid\\ntesting (NAT) of HIV-1 RNA via PCR should be performed (\\nFigure 16-1\\n).

The major dose-limiting toxicity of this agent is myelosuppression,\\nwhich is usually reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation of the drug. The usual maintenance\\ndose is 1.5-2.5 mg/kg/d in a single dose. Drug levels are generally not obtained.

Because 80% of pancreas transplants are performed with a\\nsimultaneous kidney transplant with the same immunologic status, renal allograft function and histopathology\\ncan be a valuable surrogate for diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection.\\nMost pancreas transplants are done with quadruple immunosuppression, consisting of an induction agent and\\ntriple maintenance immunosuppression, including corticosteroids. One-year posttransplant acute rejection\\nrates range between 20-30%; this contributes significantly to early and late graft loss.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nAt time of surgery, the exocrine (digestive enzymes) secretions of the pancreas can be drained into the\\nrecipient’s intestine (enteric drainage) or into the bladder (bladder drainage).\\nSerum amylase and lipase are used in both the enteric- and bladder-drained recipient to monitor for\\nrejection but lack specificity. For the bladder-drained allograft, a fall in urinary amylase correlates with\\nrejection. However, allograft biopsy remains the gold standard, demonstrating septal, ductal, and acinar\\ninflammation and endotheliitis.

Rapid upper GI bleeding can present with\\nhematochezia, typically associated with hemodynamic compromise or circulatory shock.\\nAnorectal bleeding\\n usually results in bright red blood coating the exterior of formed stool associated\\nwith distal colonic symptoms (e.g., rectal urgency, straining, or pain with defecation).\\nAnemia\\n from blood loss can cause fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, pallor, or dyspnea.\\nEstimation of the amount of blood loss is often inaccurate. If the baseline hematocrit is known, the drop in\\nhematocrit provides a rough estimate of blood loss. In general, lower GI bleeding causes less\\nhemodynamic compromise than upper GI bleeding.\\nCoagulation abnormalities\\n can propagate bleeding from a preexisting lesion in the GI tract. Disorders\\nof coagulation (e.g., liver disease, von Willebrand disease, vitamin K deficiency, and disseminated\\nintravascular coagulation) can influence the course of GI bleeding (see \\nChapter 20, Disorders of\\nHemostasis and Thrombosis\\n).\\nMedications\\n known to affect the coagulation process or platelet function include warfarin, heparin, low-\\nmolecular-weight heparin, aspirin, NSAIDs, thienopyridines (clopidogrel [Plavix], prasugrel [Effient],\\nticlopidine [Ticlid]), thrombolytic agents, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (abciximab [ReoPro],\\neptifibatide [Integrilin], tirofiban [Aggrastat]), direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, bivalirudin, dabigatran\\netexilate), and direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban [Xarelto], apixaban).'),\n",

Therefore, dual antiplatelet\\ntherapy (e.g., clopidogrel plus aspirin) or concomitant aspirin and anticoagulation with warfarin can\\nescalate the risk for GI bleeding by both initiating and propagating bleeding.\\nPhysical Examination\\nColor of stool.\\n Direct examination of spontaneously passed stool or on \\ndigital rectal examination\\n(DRE)\\n can help localize the level of bleeding. Moreover, DRE may identify anorectal abnormalities\\nincluding anal fissures, which induce extreme discomfort during the DRE.\\nFresh blood on an \\nNG aspirate\\n may indicate ongoing upper GI bleeding requiring urgent endoscopic\\nattention (\\nGastrointest Endosc 2004;59:172\\n). The aspirate should be considered positive only if blood or\\ndark particulate matter (“coffee grounds”) is seen; \\nhemoccult testing of NG aspirate has no clinical\\nutility\\n. A bleeding source in the duodenum can result in a negative NG aspirate. Gastric lavage with\\nwater or saline may be useful in assessing the activity and severity of upper GI bleeding and in clearing\\nthe stomach of blood and clots before endoscopy. After a diagnosis of upper GI bleeding is made, the NG\\ntube can be removed in a stable patient.\\nConstant monitoring or frequent assessment of vital signs is necessary early in the evaluation, as a\\nsudden increase in pulse rate or decrease in blood pressure (BP) may suggest recurrent or ongoing\\nblood loss.\\nIf the baseline BP and pulse are within normal limits, sitting the patient up and/or having the patient stand\\nmay result in \\northostatic hemodynamic changes\\n (drop in systolic BP of >20 mm Hg, rise in pulse rate\\nof >10 bpm). Orthostatic changes are seen with loss of 10-20% of the circulatory volume; supine\\nhypotension suggests a >20% loss.

Malaise, fatigue, pruritus, headache, abdominal pain,\\nmyalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever are nonspecific symptoms.\\nChronic HCV hepatitis\\n runs an indolent course, sometimes for decades. Fatigue is a common symptom.\\nThe disease may only become clinically apparent late in the natural course, when symptoms are\\nassociated with advanced liver disease.\\nExtrahepatic manifestations\\n include mixed cryoglobulinemia (10-25% of patients with HCV), glomerular\\ndiseases (mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome, membranous nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa), porphyria\\ncutanea tarda, cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, lichen planus, lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, and other\\nautoimmune disorders.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nAntibodies against HCV (anti-HCV)\\n may be undetectable for the first 8 weeks after infection. These\\nantibodies are detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). \\nAntibodies do not confer immunity.\\n The test\\nhas a sensitivity of 95-99% and a lower specificity. A false-positive test (anti-HCV positive with HCV RNA\\nnegative) may be detected in\\nthe setting of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or hypergammaglobulinemia.

Treatment with oral vitamin K\\n1\\n 1-5 mg does not reduce the risk of hemorrhage in this\\nsetting as compared to warfarin cessation alone and is not routinely recommended (\\nAnn Intern Med\\n2009;150:293\\n).\\nSevere elevation (INR ≥9) should be treated with vitamin K (e.g., oral vitamin K\\n1\\n 2-10 mg) (\\nThromb Res\\n2004;113:205\\n) unless the INR is likely to be spurious.\\nBleeding with warfarin\\nVitamin K replacement\\n should be given PO or IV. Vitamin K has variable absorption when administered\\nSC, especially in edematous patients. IV vitamin K carries the risk of anaphylactoid reactions. With adequate\\nreplacement therapy, the INR should begin to normalize within 12 hours and normalize completely in 24-48\\nhours (\\nAnn Intern Med 2002;137:251\\n). Serious hemorrhages should be treated with vitamin K (10 mg) by\\nslow IV infusion and four-factor PCC. When four-factor PCC is not available, threefactor PCC and/or FFP\\n(two or three units) can be used. Because of the long half-life of warfarin (approximately 36 hours), vitamin K\\nshould be repeated every 8-12 hours to prevent INR rebound.\\nAlthough expensive and potentially thrombogenic (\\nN Engl J Med 2010;363:1791\\n), \\nrFVIIa\\n may stop life-\\nthreatening bleeding (\\nBr J Haematol 2002;116:178\\n).\\nBleeding with UFH, LMWH, and pentasaccharide'),\n",

Hgb and Hct are unreliable indicators of red\\ncell mass in the setting of rapid shifts of intravascular volume (i.e., an acute bleed).\\nThe most useful red cell indices are:\\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV): mean volume of the red cells. Normal range: 80-100 fL.\\nMicrocytic: MCV <80 fL\\nNormocytic: MCV of 80-100 fL\\nMacrocytic: MCV >100 fL\\nRed cell distribution width (RDW): A reflection of the variability in the size of the red cells and is\\nproportional to the standard deviation of the MCV. \\nAn elevated RDW indicates an increased\\nvariability in RBC size.\\nMean cellular hemoglobin (MCH): Describes the concentration of Hgb in each cell, and an elevated\\nlevel is often indicative of spherocytes or a hemoglobinopathy.\\nThe relative reticulocyte count\\n measures the percentage of immature red cells in the blood and\\nreflects production of RBCs in the bone marrow (BM).\\nA normal RBC has a life span of approximately 120 days, and the reticulocytes circulate for about 1\\nday; therefore, the normal reticulocyte count is 1-2%.\\nIn the setting of anemia from blood loss, the BM should increase its production of RBCs in proportion\\nto loss of RBCs, and thus a 1% reticulocyte count in the setting of anemia is inappropriate.\\nThe reticulocyte index\\n (RI) is a determination of the BM's ability to respond to anemia and is\\ncalculated by % reticulocytes/maturation correction × actual Hct/normal Hct (normally 45).

For instance, exposure to alkylating agents or topoisomerase II inhibitors\\nincreases the risk of developing treatment-related leukemia, and exposure to radiation therapy increases risk\\nfor developing cancers such as breast cancer, angiosarcoma, and osteosarcoma.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nObtaining tissue is crucial for facilitating a definitive tissue diagnosis, examining molecular features, and\\ntreatment planning.\\nCytology\\n specimens often consist of only a few malignant cells that are obtained either invasively\\nthrough biopsy (fine-needle or core biopsies), brushings (Pap smear or endoscopic), or aspiration of\\nbody fluids (blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal) or noninvasively though\\ncollection of fluids such as sputum and urine. Although these approaches are relatively less invasive\\ncompared to surgical approaches and easier to pursue, cytologic samples are often inadequate for'),\n",

However, these procedures are more invasive and not feasible in all patients.\\nSTAGING\\nOnce a tissue diagnosis is obtained, most cancer patients will require additional imaging, procedures, and\\nlaboratory testing for determining the disease burden and stage. This workup is cancer and patient specific,\\nand also varies by local and institutional patterns of practice. Organizations such as the American Society of\\nClinical Oncology (ASCO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and European Society of\\nMedical Oncology (ESMO) review available evidence and issue periodic recommendations to guide\\nappropriate staging workup and management.\\nCancer stage provides an assessment of the extent of tumor dissemination, which is crucial for treatment.\\nMost malignancies are staged according to the tumor, lymph node, and metastasis (TNM) system from\\nstages I to IV.

Commonly used forms of radiation\\ninclude external-beam photons and electrons. Photons are usually x-rays or γ-rays. With the exception of\\nstereotactic radiation to the brain, γ-rays are rarely used today. Protons and neutrons are other forms of\\nexternal-beam radiation. Electrons are mostly useful for treating skin and superficial tumors.\\nBrachytherapy is an alternative method of radiation therapy, where radioactive sources are placed close\\nto or in contact with their target tissue. This ensures a higher dose delivery to the targeted tissue over a\\nshort duration of time. Brachytherapy sources can be temporary (e.g., iridium-192 in cervical cancer) or\\npermanent (e.g., iodine-125 in prostate cancer).\\nRadioactive substances can also be administered systemically. For instance, iodine-131 is administered\\norally for treating thyroid cancer, yttrium-90 microspheres are injected into the liver vasculature in\\nhepatocellular cancer, and radium-223 is dosed intravenously in patients with prostate cancer and\\nskeletal metastases.\\nRadiation planning is designed to deliver a precise dose of radiation to a tumor while sparing surrounding\\ntissues.\\nCurative\\n intent radiotherapy is used in several settings.\\nNeoadjuvant:\\n Preoperative therapy intended to reduce both the extent of surgery and the risk of local\\nrelapse. Radiation in this setting is almost always administered in combination with chemotherapy.\\nAdjuvant:\\n Postoperative therapy intended to reduce the risk of local relapse.\\nDefinitive:\\n High dose with curative intent.\\nConcurrent chemoradiation:\\n Chemotherapy with definitive radiation is associated with increased\\nefficacy but at a cost of increased toxicity compared to either chemotherapy or radiation alone.\\nPalliative\\n radiotherapy is used in lower dosing to reduce symptoms, including bone pain, obstruction,\\nbleeding, and neurologic symptoms.\\nThe total dose of radiation administered is usually spread out over time (fractionated). This allows time\\nfor normal tissue repair and increases the probability of delivering radiation to tumor cells in a'),\n",

In other regimens, treatments are\\nadministered weekly for 2-3 weeks, with 1 week off between cycles.\\nCurative\\n intent chemotherapy includes neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and chemoradiation protocols in solid\\ntumors. Chemotherapy alone is curative in many lymphomas, leukemias, and germ cell tumors.\\nPalliative\\n chemotherapy is used in advanced solid tumors and relapsed hematologic malignancies, with\\na focus on prolonging survival and improving the quality of life.\\nMost agents have a very narrow therapeutic index, and dosing is based on body surface area (mg/m\\n2\\n).\\nChemotherapy toxicities are widely variable and can be life threatening.\\nPrinciples of Targeted Therapy\\nThe advent of molecularly targeted agents has led to marked advances in the treatment of selected\\nmalignancies.\\nThe most common classes of drugs are monoclonal antibodies and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors\\n(TKIs). Monoclonal antibodies are administered IV and by standard nomenclature have names that end\\nwith the stem -mab. Substems indicate the source and target of the antibody. The most common source\\nsubstems in oncology include -xi- indicating a chimeric antibody (e.g., cetuximab), -zu- indicating\\nhumanized antibody (e.g., bevacizumab), and -u- indicating fully human antibodies (e.g., ipilimumab). The\\nmost common target substems include -ci- indicating circulatory system (e.g., bevacizumab), -tu-\\nindicating tumor (e.g., cetuximab), and -li- indicating immune system (e.g., ipilimumab).\\nTKIs are administered orally and have names that end with -ib. The most common substems include -ti-\\nindicating tyrosine kinase inhibition (e.g., imatinib) and -zom- indicating proteasome inhibition (e.g.,\\nbortezomib).\\nMost antibodies are used in combination with chemotherapy or radiation, whereas most TKIs are used as\\nsingle agents.\\nToxicities of targeted therapies are unique to each agent, although specific classes of drugs can be\\nassociated with characteristic side effects.\\nInhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently cause an acnelike rash on the\\nface and upper chest, which can be severe.

It is estimated that nearly 59,000 patients will be diagnosed with HNSCC in the year 2015. Tobacco\\nuse and alcohol consumption are associated with increased risk of developing HNSCC. HPV infection is\\nimplicated in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and the incidence of HPV-associated HNSCC has\\nquadrupled since the 1980s. EBV infection is associated with nasopharyngeal cancers.\\nField cancerization\\n is an important concept in HNSCC. Given the diffuse nature of mucosal exposure to\\ntobacco smoke, the primary cancer site is often surrounded by areas of premalignant lesions (carcinoma in\\nsitu and dysplasia). For this reason, patients with tobacco-associated HNSCC are at increased risk for\\ndeveloping secondary cancers.\\nLeukoplakia and erythroleukoplakia\\n are premalignant lesions of the oral mucosa. Leukoplakia refers to a\\nwhite mucosal patch that cannot be scraped off, whereas erythroleukoplakia appears red and velvety.\\nErythroleukoplakias are associated with a higher risk of malignant transformation.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nPatients with HNSCC can present with a variety of symptoms depending on the primary tumor site: oral\\nmass, nonhealing ulcers, trismus from invasion of pterygoid muscles, dysphagia, odynophagia, otitis media\\nfrom eustachian tube blockage, hoarseness, neck mass, weight loss, and cranial nerve palsies.\\nNasopharyngeal tumors can invade the cavernous sinus and frequently affect the abducens and trigeminal\\nnerves. Salivary gland tumors, which can have nonsquamous pathology, can invade the facial nerve and\\ncause facial nerverelated symptoms.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nComprehensive ear, nose, and throat (ENT) evaluation with fiberoptic endoscopy or mirror exam is\\nrequired. Particular attention should be paid to assess dentition. Functional evaluation that includes\\nassessment of swallowing, biting, chewing, and speech should be performed.\\nExamination under anesthesia is a critical component of staging. Imaging should include a panorex to\\nevaluate dentition and mandibular bony involvement. A CT of the neck and chest should be obtained to\\nevaluate lymph node involvement and rule out pulmonary metastases, respectively. Whole-body PET can\\nbe considered in select patients.\\np16 positivity on IHC is used as a surrogate for HPV infection and is an independent favorable prognostic\\nfactor for survival (\\nN Engl J Med 2010;363:24\\n).\\nStage classification:\\n Stage I to II disease does not show lymph node involvement. Stage III tumors are\\nlarger (defined as >4 cm for most sites) or have isolated lymph node involvement. Stage IVA/B tumors are\\nlocally advanced tumors or show bilateral or bulky cervical lymph node involvement. Stage IVC tumors\\nare associated with distant metastasis.\\nTREATMENT\\nEarly stage (I-II): Either surgery or definitive radiation.\\nLocally advanced (stage III-IVA/B): Treatment approaches include:\\nDefinitive surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation with or without chemotherapy'),\n",

The most common\\nsymptoms are anemia, hematuria, cachexia, and fever. The classic triad of flank pain, hematuria, and a\\npalpable mass is uncommonly seen. Hypercalcemia is the most common paraneoplastic manifestation of\\nRCC. Although erythrocytosis from erythropoietin production can be seen in RCC, anemia is more common.\\nStauffer syndrome refers to a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by nonmetastatic hepatic dysfunction\\nseen in RCC.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nCT is usually sufficient for staging. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be useful for\\nfurther evaluation of the collecting system and inferior vena cava for involvement. The role of PET imaging\\nis limited because normal renal tissue excretes fluorodeoxyglucose in the urine and has a high background\\nactivity.

African American ethnicity, family history, and a high-fat/low-vegetable diet are a few\\npredisposing risk factors.\\nScreening\\nThe absolute risk reduction in mortality from annual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is modest and should be\\ndiscussed with patients older than 50 years of age with known risk factors. The USPSTF currently does not\\nrecommend annual PSA-based screening, although there are conflicting data from American and European trials\\nlooking at the benefit of prostate cancer screening.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nThe most common presentation in the United States is asymptomatic elevation in PSA. Digital rectal\\nexamination (DRE) findings of asymmetric induration or nodules are suggestive, and any palpable nodule\\nshould be biopsied. Less common symptoms are obstructive symptoms, new-onset erectile dysfunction,\\nhematuria, or hematospermia. Bone is the most common site of metastatic involvement, and patients with\\nskeletal metastases can present with pain, fractures, and nerve root compression.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nDRE supplemented by transrectal ultrasound helps in assessing T stage. PSA testing and Gleason scoring\\nin the initial biopsy are important in staging and risk category assessment. Although patients with high-risk\\ndisease are likely to benefit from routine imaging (CT, MRI, or bone scan) for detection of metastatic\\ndisease, symptom-directed imaging is appropriate in patients with low-risk disease.\\nGleason grades range from 1 to 5. Grade 1 is assigned to well-differentiated and grade 5 to poorly\\ndifferentiated gland pattern. \\nGleason score\\n is the sum of the grades for the primary and secondary\\npatterns seen on the biopsy.\\nRisk categorization: Based on these characteristics, tumors are classified as low (PSA ≤10 ng/mL,\\nGleason score <7, and stage up to T2a), intermediate (PSA >10 to ≤20 ng/mL, Gleason score 7, and\\nstage T2b), or high (PSA >20 ng/mL, Gleason score >7, and stage T2c) risk.\\nStaging\\nEarly stage disease (T1-T2) is confined to the prostate, and locally advanced disease (T3-T4) is defined by\\nlocal invasion.

Transformation from chronic phase to blast phase can be insidious\\nthrough the accelerated phase or abrupt.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nThe presence of the \\nBCR-ABL1\\n rearrangement by cytogenetics, FISH, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\\nin the peripheral blood or bone marrow confirms the diagnosis of CML. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is\\nperformed prior to treatment initiation to establish a baseline and then every 3 months to monitor response\\nto treatment.\\nTREATMENT\\nMost patients are initially treated with oral TKIs such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. The choice of\\nagent typically depends on treatment-related adverse effects and patient preference. Phase III trials\\ncomparing second-generation TKIs (dasatinib or nilotinib) to imatinib as initial therapy for CML in chronic\\nphase have demonstrated faster and deeper responses with the former.\\nComplete hematologic remission (CHR) is defined as normalization of peripheral blood counts and\\nabsence of splenomegaly, whereas complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) is defined by the absence of\\nPhiladelphia chromosome metaphases on bone marrow cytogenetic analysis; major molecular remission\\n(MMR) is defined by qPCR when \\nBCR-ABL1\\n transcripts in the peripheral blood are ≤0.1% on the\\nInternational Scale (IS). Complete molecular remission (CMR) defined by the absence of \\nBCR-ABL1\\ntranscripts by qPCR is a misleading term because a very low burden of malignant clone may still be\\npresent in\\nthese patients, and therefore, it has been proposed to not use this term any more. CHR and/or \\nBCR-\\nABL1\\n transcripts in the marrow ≤10% (IS) by 3 months, CCyR and/or \\nBCR-ABL1\\n transcripts in the\\nmarrow ≤1% (IS) by 6 months, and \\nBCR-ABL1\\n transcripts in the marrow ≤0.1% (IS) by 12 months after\\nstarting a TKI constitute an optimal response to therapy (\\nBlood 2013;122:872\\n).\\nFailure to achieve treatment milestones often requires switching therapies. Many patients who respond\\ninitially to first-line TKIs may eventually develop acquired resistance. For patients with resistance,\\nponatinib and omacetaxine are available, although they do not provide long-term disease control.\\nStem cell transplantation can be considered in patients who relapse after initial response to TKIs and/or\\nwho develop resistance to TKIs.\\nBlast crises are more challenging to manage, and treatment often involves TKIs, chemotherapy, and stem\\ncell transplantation.\\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES'),\n",

Patients can also have bone pain, renal failure, fatigue, elevated\\ncreatinine, weight loss, and hypercalcemia. Patients with extramedullary plasmacytomas can present with\\nradiculopathy, cord compression, or CNS involvement.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nInitial evaluation includes routine blood work, β\\n2\\n-microglobulin (B2M), serum and urine protein\\nelectrophoresis, serum free light chain estimation, skeletal survey, and bone marrow exam. The diagnosis is\\nconfirmed by the presence of 10% or more clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow or a biopsy-proven\\nplasmacytoma, with evidence of end-organ damage (hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, or bone\\nlesions). A clonal marrow plasma cell percentage of ≥60%, κ or λ free light chain ratio of ≥100, and the\\npresence of one or more focal lesions on MRI are also criteria for diagnosis of myeloma because they are\\nassociated with a high risk of progression to end-organ damage (\\nLancet Oncol 2014;15:e538\\n).\\nSTAGING\\nThe International Staging System for MM uses B2M and albumin to stratify patients into: stage I (B2M <3.5\\nmg/dL and albumin >3.5 g/dL), stage II (albumin <3.5 g/dL or B2M 3.5-5.5 mg/dL), and stage III (B2M >5.5\\nmg/dL).\\nCytogenetic features (\\nTable 22-13\\n) can be used for risk stratification and guiding treatment (\\n Am J Hematol\\n2014;89:999\\n).\\nTREATMENT\\nTransplant-eligible patients are offered autologous stem cell transplantation following approximately 4\\nmonths of treatment with one of the previously mentioned regimens,'),\n",

In addition to facilitating the administration of high doses of chemotherapy, allogeneic\\ntransplantation also allows for an immunologic effect mediated by donor T and natural killer (NK) cells (graft-\\nversus-tumor effect).\\nIndications\\nStem cell transplantation can be considered for patients with progressive or residual disease that is\\nthought to be chemoresponsive or susceptible to graft-versus-tumor effect.

Herrick\\nJanet B. McGill\\nDiabetes Mellitus\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nDiabetes mellitus (DM)\\n is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in\\ninsulin secretion, insulin action, or both. In 2012, DM was present in 12.3% of persons over the age of 20 years in the\\nUnited States and 25.9% of those over the age of 65 years. A substantial percentage of affected persons are not\\ndiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) represents 90-95% of all cases of diabetes, with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and\\nother causes representing the remaining 5-10% (\\nNational Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014\\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/2014-report-estimates-of-diabetes-and-its-burden-in-the-united-states.pdf\\n).\\nPersons with diabetes are at risk for microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and\\nneuropathy, and are at increased risk for macrovascular disease.\\nT2DM is accompanied by hypertension (approximately 75%) and hyperlipidemia (>50%) in adult patients and is\\nconsidered a “cardiac risk equivalent” because of the excess risk for macrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease\\n(CVD) events, and mortality (\\nDiabetes Care 2012;35(suppl 1):S11\\n).\\nClassification\\nDM\\n is classified into four clinical classes (\\nDiabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S8\\n).\\nT1DM accounts for <10% of all cases of DM and results from a cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the beta\\n(β) cells of the pancreas.\\nT2DM accounts for >90% of all cases of diabetes. T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance followed by reduced\\ninsulin secretion from β cells that are unable to compensate for the increased insulin requirements.\\nOther specific types of DM\\n include those that result from genetic defects in insulin secretion or action (monogenic\\ndiabetes such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young), pancreatic surgery or disease of the\\nexocrine pancreas (cystic fibrosis), endocrinopathies (e.g., Cushing syndrome, acromegaly), or drugs\\n(corticosteroids, antiretroviral, atypical antipsychotics), and diabetes associated with other syndromes.\\nGestational DM\\n (GDM) is glucose intolerance with onset or diagnosis during pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM\\ndepends on the criteria used for diagnosis and varies by age and ethnic group (generally from 5-6% of pregnancies\\nto 15-20% of pregnancies). Diagnostic criteria for GDM vary based on practice location with a two-step method (50-g,\\n1-hour screen followed by 100-g, 3-h oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) used in the United States and a one-step\\nmethod (75-g, 2-hour OGTT) more common internationally (\\nDiabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S13\\n). About 60% of\\nwomen with GDM will develop T2DM in the ensuing 5-10 years, and all remain at an increased risk for the\\ndevelopment of T2DM later in life (\\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs\\n).\\nAll patients with GDM should undergo diagnostic testing 6-12 weeks postpartum with a 2-h OGTT or fasting\\nplasma glucose and every 1-3 years thereafter to determine whether abnormal carbohydrate metabolism has\\npersisted or is recurrent (\\nDiabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S79\\n).\\nWeight loss and exercise are encouraged to decrease the risk of persistent prediabetes or T2DM after delivery.\\nDIAGNOSIS'),\n",

Patients using multiple daily injections or insulin pumps\\nshould test themselves three or more times daily. Less frequent testing may be appropriate for those on\\nnoninsulin therapies. Although most SMBG is done before meals and at bedtime, periodic testing 1-2 hours\\nafter eating may be necessary to achieve postprandial glucose targets (\\nDiabetes Care 2015;38(suppl\\n1):S33\\n).\\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM)\\n has been shown to reduce A1C in adults older than 25 years on\\nintensive insulin therapy. CGM measures interstitial glucose, which provides a close approximation of BG\\nvalues. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia alarms may help patients with widely fluctuating BG levels or\\nhypoglycemia unawareness. CGM is supplemental to SMBG (\\nN Engl J Med 2008;359:1464\\n).\\nA1C\\n provides an integrated measure of BG values over the preceding 2-3 months. A1C should be obtained\\nevery 3 months in patients not at goal or when either diabetes therapy or clinical condition changes and twice\\nyearly in well-controlled patients. A1C should confirm results of SMBG, and discordant values should be\\ninvestigated. An A1C level that is higher than expected should be evaluated by a diabetes educator to ensure\\nmeter accuracy, appropriate technique, and frequency of testing. When the A1C is lower than expected, blood\\nloss, transfusion, hemolysis, and hemoglobin variants should be considered. The correlation between A1C\\nand mean plasma glucose is sufficiently strong that laboratory reports may include both the A1C result and\\nthe estimated average glucose (\\nDiabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S34\\n).\\nKetones\\n can be detected in a fingerstick blood sample by measuring β-hydroxybutyrate with the handheld\\nglucose/ketone meter, Precision Xtra. Urine ketones can be qualitatively identified, using Ketostix or Acetest\\ntablets. Patients with T1DM should test for ketones during febrile illness, for persistent elevation of glucose\\n(>300 mg/dL), or if signs of impending diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) develop.\\nTesting for β-hydroxybutyrate is useful in emergency departments to determine whether a patient with\\nhyperglycemia has ketonemia (\\nAcad Emerg Med 2006; 13(6):683\\n).

Therefore, ketoacidosis as\\nan initial presentation is more common in young patients.\\nT1DM is characterized by severe insulin deficiency. Exogenous insulin is required to control BGs, prevent DKA,\\nand preserve life. Ketosis develops in 8-16 hours and ketoacidosis in 12-24 hours without insulin.\\nEarly in the course of T1DM, some insulin secretory capacity remains, and the insulin requirement may be lower\\nthan expected (0.3-0.4 units/kg). Tight control of BG level from the onset has been shown to preserve the\\nresidual β-cell function and prevent or delay later complications.\\nLatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is characterized by mild to moderate hyperglycemia at\\npresentation that often responds to noninsulin therapies initially. Adults with LADA will have one or more β cell-\\nspecific autoantibodies and tend to require insulin therapy sooner than patients with classic T2DM (months to\\nyears).\\nT1DM should be suspected when there is a family history of T1DM, thyroid disease, or other autoimmune\\ndisease. Presentation with ketoacidosis suggests T1DM, but confirmatory tests may be useful to guide therapy.\\nAutoantibodies include islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), antibodies to insulin, antibodies to glutamic acid\\ndecarboxylase (anti-GAD), antibodies to zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), and antibodies to tyrosine phosphatases IA-2\\nand IA-2β. Measuring one or more of these autoantibodies along with a C-peptide can help to confirm the\\ndiagnosis of T1DM; however, 20% of insulin-deficient adults are antibody negative (\\nDiabetes Care\\n2015;38(suppl 1):S10\\n).\\nTREATMENT\\nTreatment of T1DM\\n requires lifelong insulin replacement and careful coordination of insulin doses with food\\nintake and activity.\\nInsulin preparations.\\n After SC injection, there is individual variability in the duration and peak activity of insulin\\npreparations and day-to-day variability in the same subject (\\nTable 23-4\\n).\\nSC insulin administration.\\n The abdomen, thighs, buttocks, and upper arms are the preferred sites for SC\\ninsulin injection. Absorption is fastest from the abdomen, followed by the arm, buttocks, and thigh, probably as a\\nresult of differences in blood flow.

The total premeal complement should roughly equal the\\ntotal basal dose, with one-third given before or after each meal. Rapid-acting insulins (lispro, aspart, or\\nglulisine) are preferred, but regular human insulin can be used.\\nThe third component of a comprehensive insulin regimen is “correction factor” insulin, which is similar to\\nsliding scale, adjusted according to the premeal fingerstick glucose testing and the patient's estimated insulin\\nsensitivity. In general, thinner patients should use a less aggressive scale than heavier or more insulin-\\nresistant patients. Correction factor and premeal doses should use the same insulin and be given together in\\nthe same syringe.\\nContinuous SC insulin infusion\\n using an insulin pump is widely used for insulin delivery in patients with T1DM\\nand increasingly in T2DM. It is a useful tool but does not automatically improve glucose control without patient\\nself-management.\\nA typical regimen provides 50% of total daily insulin as basal insulin and the remainder as multiple preprandial\\nboluses of insulin, using a programmable insulin pump. A rapid-acting insulin (aspart, lispro, or glulisine) is\\nused to fill the pump and is infused continuously to provide basal insulin.\\nInsulin pumps have advanced features that allow patients to fine-tune their basal and bolus doses but require\\ndiabetes education to use the pump to its full potential. Patients must check their blood sugars regularly\\nbecause DKA can occur rapidly if the insulin infusion is disrupted (i.e., faulty infusion set).\\nType 2 Diabetes\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nT2DM results from defective insulin secretion followed by loss of β-cell mass in response to increased demand as a\\nresult of insulin resistance (\\nDiabetes 1988;37:667\\n).\\nT2DM is usually diagnosed in adults, with both incidence and prevalence increasing with age; however, T2DM now\\naccounts for up to one-third of new cases of diabetes diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 15 years.\\nT2DM is associated with obesity, family history of diabetes, history of GDM or prediabetes, hypertension, physical\\ninactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Latinos, Asian Indians, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and\\nsome groups of Asians have a greater risk of developing T2DM than Caucasians.\\nT2DM may be asymptomatic and, therefore, can remain undiagnosed for months to years.\\nThe loss of pancreatic β cells is progressive. Insulin secretion is usually sufficient to prevent ketosis, but DKA or HHS\\ncan develop during severe stress. T2DM in patients who present with or later develop ketosis or DKA, but who do not\\nrequire insulin between episodes, is termed ketosis-prone T2DM.\\nThe mechanisms underlying the β-cell loss in T2DM are unknown, but programmed cell death in response to genetic\\nand environmental factors has been demonstrated in animal models (\\nDiabetes 2003;52:2304\\n).\\nTREATMENT\\nMedications\\nThe achievement of glycemic control requires individualized therapy and a comprehensive approach that\\nincorporates lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. Guidelines have been published by several professional\\norganizations regarding the choice and sequence of antidiabetic therapy (\\nEndocr Pract 2015;15:e6\\n; \\nDiabetes\\nCare 2015:38 (supplement 1)\\n).\\nConsiderations for selecting noninsulin therapy (\\nTable 23-5\\n) in patients with T2DM include the following:\"),\n",

These complications are\\ndirectly related to hyperglycemia. Tight glycemic control has been shown to reduce the development and progression\\nof these complications.\\nDiabetic Retinopathy\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nClassification\\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is classified as background retinopathy (microaneurysms, retinal infarcts, lipid exudates,\\ncotton wool spots, and/or microhemorrhages) with or without macular edema and proliferative retinopathy.\\nBackground DR is also known as preproliferative retinopathy.\\nOther ocular abnormalities associated with diabetes include cataract formation, dyskinetic pupils, glaucoma, optic\\nneuropathy, extraocular muscle paresis, floaters, and fluctuating visual acuity. The latter may be related to changes\\nin BG levels.\\nThe presence of floaters may be indicative of preretinal or vitreous hemorrhage; immediate referral for ophthalmologic\\nevaluation is warranted.\\nEpidemiology\\nThe incidence of DR and vision impairment has dropped significantly with improved management of glycemia, blood\\npressure, and lipids in patients with both T1DM and T2DM. Early identification and treatment of DR have further\\nreduced vision impairment once it is diagnosed. DR is less frequent in T2DM, but maculopathy may be more severe. DR\\nis still the leading cause of vision loss in adults younger than age 65 years (\\nN Engl J Med 2012;366:1227\\n).\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nAnnual examination by an ophthalmologist is recommended at the time of diagnosis of all T2DM patients and at the\\nbeginning of puberty or 3-5 years after diagnosis for patients with T1DM.

Any diabetic patient with visual symptoms should be referred for\\nophthalmologic evaluation (\\nDiabetes Care 2012;35(suppl 1):S64\\n).\\nTREATMENT\\nThe first line of treatment is glycemic control, which has been shown to reduce the incidence and progression of\\nDR in patients with T1DM or T2DM. Blood pressure control was also shown to be effective in the United Kingdom\\nProspective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), and treatment with either an ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) or ARB has\\ndemonstrated additional utility in preventing DR. Fenofibrate, used with simvastatin, reduced the risk of\\nprogression of DR in the ACCORD and FIELD clinical trials (\\nN Engl J Med 2012;366:1227\\n). Background\\nretinopathy is not usually associated with loss of vision unless macular edema is present (25% of cases). The\\ndevelopment of macular edema or proliferative retinopathy (particularly new vessels near the optic disk) requires\\nelective laser photocoagulation therapy to preserve vision. Intraocular injections of vascular endothelial growth\\nfactor (VEGF)-neutralizing antibodies or glucocorticoids improve vision outcomes in macular edema but have side\\neffects. Vitrectomy is indicated for patients with vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment.\\nDiabetic Nephropathy\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nEpidemiology\\nApproximately 25-45% of patients with either type of diabetes develop clinically evident diabetic nephropathy during\\ntheir lifetime. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States and a\\nmajor cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes (\\nMed Clin North Am 2004;88:1001\\n).\\nRisk Factors\\nThe newest ADA guidelines no longer distinguish between microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, defining\\nalbuminuria as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g (\\nDiabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S58\\n). The mean duration\\nfrom diagnosis of T1DM to the development of overt proteinuria has increased significantly and is now >25 years. The\\ntime from the occurrence of proteinuria to ESRD has also increased and is now >5 years. In T2DM, albuminuria can be\\npresent at the time of diagnosis. Poor glycemic control is the major risk factor for diabetic nephropathy, but hypertension\\nand smoking are contributors. Obesity may contribute to kidney damage in T2DM. Due to the widespread use of ACE\\ninhibitor and ARB agents for the treatment of hypertension, impaired kidney function may occur in the absence of\\nalbuminuria (\\nDiabetes Care 2015;38(suppl 1):S60\\n).\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of diabetic nephropathy\\n starts at the time of diagnosis with achievement of glycemic, blood\\npressure, and lipid targets. Smoking cessation is also important. Annual screening for albuminuria and\\nmeasurement of serum creatinine identify those with early damage who are at risk of progression. Annual\\nscreening should be performed in T1DM patients who have had diabetes for >5 years and all T2DM patients\\nstarting at diagnosis.\\nAssociated Conditions\\nPatients with proteinuria (albumin/creatinine >300 mg/g) are at higher risk for anemia due to loss of transferrin and\\npoor production of erythropoietin and should be screened at any stage of CKD and treated.\\nPatients with CKD are at higher risk for CVD and mortality\\n, so management of other CV risk factors is'),\n",

In diabetic patients, the risk of PVD is increased by age,\\nduration of diabetes, and presence of peripheral neuropathy.\\nPVD is a marker for systemic vascular disease involving coronary, cerebral, and renal vessels. Diabetic patients with\\nPVD have increased risk for subsequent MI or stroke regardless of the PVD symptoms.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nSymptoms of PVD include intermittent claudication, rest pain, tissue loss, and gangrene, but patients with diabetes\\nmay have fewer symptoms due to concomitant neuropathy.\\nPhysical Examination\\nPhysical examination findings include diminished pulses, dependent rubor, pallor on elevation, absence of hair\\ngrowth, dystrophic toenails, and cool, dry, fissured skin.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nThe ankle-to-brachial index (ABI), defined as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle divided by the\\nsystolic blood pressure at the arm, is the best initial diagnostic test. An ABI <0.9 by a handheld, 5- to 10-MHz\\nDoppler probe has a 95% sensitivity for detecting angiogram-positive PVD (\\nInt J Epidemiol 1988;17:248\\n).\\nABI should be performed in diabetic patients with signs or symptoms of PVD.\\nTREATMENT\\nRisk factors should be controlled, with similar goals described for CAD (see the previous text).\\nAntiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel (75 mg/d) have additional benefits when compared with aspirin in\\ndiabetic patients with PVD (\\nDiabetes Care 2003;26:3333\\n).\\nPatients with intermittent claudication could also benefit from exercise rehabilitation and cilostazol (100 mg bid).\\nThis medication is contraindicated in patients with CHF.\\nMISCELLANEOUS COMPLICATIONS\\nErectile Dysfunction\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nEpidemiology\\nIt is estimated that 40-60% of men with diabetes have erectile dysfunction (ED), and the prevalence varies\\ndepending on the age of the patient and duration of diabetes.

Only the free (unbound) fraction enters cells and produces biologic effects.\\nT\\n4\\n secretion is stimulated by \\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\\n. In turn, TSH secretion is inhibited by T\\n4\\n,\\nforming a negative feedback loop that keeps free T\\n4\\n levels within a narrow normal range. Diagnosis of thyroid\\ndisease is based on clinical findings, palpation of the thyroid, and measurement of plasma TSH and thyroid\\nhormones.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nThyroid palpation\\n determines the size and consistency of the thyroid and the presence of nodules,\\ntenderness, or a thrill.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nPlasma TSH is the best initial test in most patients with suspected thyroid disease\\n.

All three forms of euthyroid goiter are common, especially in\\nwomen.\\nThyroid scans and ultrasonography (US) provide no useful additional information about goiters that are diffuse\\nby palpation and should not be performed in these patients.\\nBetween 30-50% of people have nonpalpable thyroid nodules that are detectable by ultrasound. These\\nnodules rarely have any clinical importance, but their incidental discovery may lead to unnecessary diagnostic\\ntesting and treatment.\\nDiffuse goiter\\nAlmost all euthyroid diffuse goiters in the United States are due to \\nchronic lymphocytic thyroiditis\\n(Hashimoto thyroiditis)\\n. Because Hashimoto thyroiditis may also cause hypothyroidism, plasma TSH\\nshould be measured.\\nDiffuse goiters are usually asymptomatic, and therapy is seldom required. Patients should be monitored\\nregularly for the development of hypothyroidism.\\nMNG\\nMNG is common in older patients, especially women. Most patients are asymptomatic and require no\\ntreatment.\\nIn a few patients, \\nhyperthyroidism\\n (toxic MNG) develops (see \\nHyperthyroidism\\n section).\\nIn rare patients, the gland compresses the trachea or esophagus, causing dyspnea or dysphagia, and\\ntreatment is required. Thyroxine treatment has little, if any, effect on the size of MNGs. RAI therapy reduces\\ngland size and relieves symptoms in most patients. Subtotal thyroidectomy can also be used to relieve\\ncompressive symptoms.\\nEvaluation for thyroid carcinoma with needle biopsy is warranted if there is a dominant nodule (a nodule\\nthat is disproportionately larger than the rest). Some centers have adopted a policy of performing thyroid US\\nin all patients with MNG and evaluating all nodules larger than 1 cm by needle biopsy. This policy\\ndramatically increases the number of thyroid biopsies and the cost of managing this common condition.\\nThere is no evidence that routine thyroid US improves clinical outcomes in patients with MNG.\\nSingle thyroid nodules\\nSingle palpable thyroid nodules\\n are usually benign, but about 5% are thyroid carcinomas.'),\n",

Local and systemic\\nsigns of infection may be partially masked, although fever associated with infection generally is not\\nsuppressed. A skin test for TB should be performed before glucocorticoid therapy is instituted, and if\\nit is positive, TB should be treated appropriately.

Suspect the\\ndiagnosis in patients presenting with symmetric arthritis in three or more joints especially involving small\\njoints and associated with morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes.\\nDiagnostic Testing\\nRF may be positive in 80% of patients. Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies may be detected in 50-\\n60% of patients with early RA.\\nCCP antibodies are more specific (>90%) for RA than is the RF, which can also be elevated in the setting\\nof hepatitis C and other chronic infections.\\nHand and wrist radiographs may show early changes of erosions or periarticular osteopenia.\\nMusculoskeletal MRI and ultrasonography are more sensitive than plain radiographs and may be used in\\nequivocal cases to demonstrate clinically inapparent synovitis or erosions.\\nTREATMENT\\nMost patients can benefit from an early aggressive treatment program that combines medical, rehabilitative,\\nand surgical services designed with three distinct goals: (a) early\\nsuppression of inflammation in the joints and other tissues, (b) maintenance of joint and muscle function and\\nprevention of deformities, and (c) repair of joint damage to relieve pain or improve function.\\nDMARDs\\n appear to alter the natural history of RA by retarding the progression of bony erosions and\\ncartilage loss. Because RA may lead to substantial long-term disability (and is associated with increased\\nmortality), the standard of care is to initiate therapy with such agents early in the course of RA. Once a\\nclinical response has been achieved, the chosen drug usually is continued indefinitely at the lowest\\neffective dosage to prevent relapse.\\nAn established diagnosis of RA along with any evidence of disease activity is an indication to'),\n",

The bougie can be used blindly but is\\nbetter suited for direct laryngoscopy where the intubator cannot visualize the cords. The goal is to obtain the\\nbest view possible and for the coude tip of the bougie to be distal and anterior. When the bougie is in the\\ntrachea, you can often feel the tracheal rings as you slide the bougie back and forth. Alternatively, you can\\npush the bougie down the oropharynx as deep as possible without losing control of it. If in\\nthe esophagus, the bougie will slide all the way down past the stomach with minimal resistance. If in the\\ntrachea, the bougie will quickly hit a bronchus and meet resistance. Once you are in the trachea, you can\\nsimply slide an endotracheal tube (ETT) over the bougie and verify placement as you normally would.\\nLaryngeal mask airway (LMA)\\n is an easy-to-use rescue device for nearly all airway events. It is an ETT with\\na balloon at the end that is inflated to cup the trachea while occluding the esophagus. Note that it should not\\nbe used in patients with upper airway obstruction that cannot be cleared or patients with excessive airway\\npressures such as with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or pregnancy. There are\\nmodels of LMAs (which are preferred) that allow an ETT to be passed through them when a definitive airway\\nis desired. Be cautious with excessive bagging because this can lead to emesis.\\nSupraglottic airway devices\\n are placed blindly in the oropharynx and inflated with air. An upper balloon\\nobstructs the oropharynx while a lower balloon obstructs the esophagus, allowing ventilation in a similar\\nfashion to an LMA with the same limitations. Note that you cannot intubate through a supraglottic device as\\nyou can with intubating LMAs.\\nFiberoptic/digital airway devices\\n are considered by many the new standard of care. These devices allow\\nthe intubator to get a view of the vocal cords via a camera or fiberoptic scope without having to view it through\\nthe mouth, making intubation much easier. Excessive secretions or blood can obstruct the camera, so the\\nperson using these devices needs to be capable of direct laryngoscopy as well as indirect fiberoptic\\nlaryngoscopy.\\nPneumothorax\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\\nPneumothorax may occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma.\\nPrimary spontaneous pneumothorax\\n occurs without obvious underlying lung disease.\\nSecondary spontaneous pneumothorax\\n results from underlying parenchymal lung disease including\\nCOPD and emphysema, interstitial lung disease, necrotizing lung infections, \\nPneumocystis jirovecii\\npneumonia, TB, and cystic fibrosis.\\nTraumatic pneumothoraces\\n occur as a result of penetrating or blunt chest wounds.\\nIatrogenic pneumothorax\\n occurs after thoracentesis, central line placement, transbronchial biopsy,\\ntransthoracic needle biopsy, and barotrauma from mechanical ventilation and resuscitation.\\nTension pneumothorax\\n results from continued accumulation of air in the chest that is sufficient to shift\\nmediastinal structures and impede venous return to the heart. This results in hypotension, abnormal gas\\nexchange, and ultimately, cardiovascular collapse.\\nCauses include barotrauma due to mechanical ventilation, a chest wound that allows ingress but not egress\\nof air, or a defect in the visceral pleura that behaves in the same way (“ball-valve” effect).'),\n",

In addition, the patient's trachea may be shifted to the\\ncontralateral side.\\nIf the pneumothorax is the result of penetrating trauma or pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous\\nemphysema may be felt.\\nClinical features alone do not predict the relative size of a pneumothorax, and in a stable patient, further\\ndiagnostic studies must be used in order to guide treatment strategy.

Conversely, absence of these\\nsigns is a highly reliable predictor for the presence of pneumothorax. Several places on the chest should\\nbe evaluated, including places that air is most likely to accumulate such as the anterior and lateral chest\\n(\\nChest 2012;141:1099\\n).

Obtain follow-up radiographs to confirm resolution of the pneumothorax in 7-10 days. Air\\ntravel is discouraged during the follow-up period, because a decrease in ambient barometric pressure\\nresults in a larger pneumothorax.\\nIf the pneumothorax is \\nsmall but the patient is mildly symptomatic\\n, far from home, or unlikely to\\ncooperate with follow-up, admit the patient and administer high-flow oxygen; the resulting nitrogen\\ngradient will speed resorption.\\nIf the patient is \\nmore than mildly symptomatic or has a larger pneumothorax\\n, simple aspiration is\\na reasonable initial management strategy.

The infusion is\\nthen continued if there are signs of toxicity. To simplify the approach, hospitals have developed their own\\nprotocols. At Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the protocol is to administer the loading dose over 1 hour followed\\nby a continuous infusion at 14 mg/kg/h for the next 20 hours.\\nNAC indications:\\n NAC treatment should be started in the following:\\nAny patient after acute poisoning with a toxic APAP level according to the nomogram.\\nPatients who present beyond 8 hours after acute ingestion. Start NAC therapy while awaiting the initial\\nAPAP serum concentration and LFTs.

Many of these syndromes are associated with antiganglioside\\nantibodies directed against gangliosides located in the axolemma near the nodes of Ranvier.

However, despite the identification of these additional antigens, “seronegative” forms still account\\nfor up to 10% of MG patients. One must consider hereditary/congenital forms of MG and avoid mistakenly\\nlumping these patients or the anti-LRP4 or anti-MuSK patients into this group.\\nAssociated Conditions\\nMG is often associated with thymus hyperplasia; 10% may have a malignant thymoma. Hyperplasia is more\\ncommon in those under 40 years of age.

Overdoses are\\ncommon in the emergency department, and although they are rarely fatal, it is important to follow some\\ngeneral guidelines while caring for the poisoned patient.\\nPatients who present to the hospital with an overdose can be challenging for the clinician. This section will\\nbegin with a review of the general approach to the poisoned patient, followed by a discussion of specific\\ningestions.\\nWhen managing the poisoned patient, as with all patients, it is vital to make sure the patient has a patent\\nairway, intact breathing, and palpable pulses. Beyond the basics of general emergency management, it is\\nimportant to remember physiologic principles when approaching the poisoned patient. Quite often, patients\\ncan be categorized into one of five common toxidromes based on simple clinical examination findings.\\nHowever, there are more than five unique toxidromes.\\nDefinition\\nA \\ntoxidrome\\n, or toxic syndrome, is a constellation of clinical examination findings that assists in the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of the patient who presents following an exposure to an unknown agent. The\\ntoxicologic physical examination should include documentation of \\nvital signs\\n, \\npupillary diameter\\n, and\\nskin findings\\n (dry, flushed, or diaphoretic), as well as the presence or absence of \\nbowel sounds\\n and\\nurinary retention\\n.\\nClassification\\nThere are \\nfive general toxidromes\\n that encompass a variety of xenobiotic exposures. They include the\\nfollowing:\\nSympathomimetic:\\n This toxidrome is characterized by widespread activation of the sympathetic nervous\\nsystem. The vital sign abnormalities include \\nhypertension\\n due to α-adrenergic stimulation and \\ntachycardia\\ndue to increased β-adrenergic tone. Patients may also present with pyrexia. Physical examination will reveal\\npupillary dilatation\\n, \\ndiaphoresis\\n, and occasionally, altered mental status. Drugs that can cause this type of\\ntoxidrome include cocaine, amphetamines, and the newer synthetic analogs (both the cannabinoids and\\ncathinones). Likewise, vasopressors and β-adrenergic agonists can cause a partial syndrome depending on\\nwhich agent is being used.\\nCholinergic:\\n This toxidrome is characterized by the widespread activation of the parasympathetic nervous'),\n",

Classically, the vital signs associated with a cholinergic toxidrome include \\nbradycardia\\n due to\\nincreased vagal tone, \\nrespiratory depression\\n due to paralysis, and \\ndecreased oxygen saturations\\n on\\npulse oximetry, due to \\nbronchoconstriction\\n and \\nbronchorrhea\\n. Excess acetylcholine (ACh) affects\\nmuscarinic receptors leading to the development of pinpoint pupils and the SLUDGE syndrome of \\nsalivation,\\nlacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal (GI) distress, and emesis\\n.\\nExcess ACh at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) results in a depolarizing blockade of the muscles, leading to\\nfasciculations\\n and \\nparalysis\\n. In the central nervous system (CNS), cholinergic overload is associated with\\nthe development of \\nseizures\\n and \\ncoma\\n. Agents linked with the development of this toxidrome all block the\\nfunction of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), resulting in the accumulation of ACh in the synapse. These agents\\ninclude organophosphate insecticides and nerve gases, as well as carbamate pesticides. Carbamates are\\nalso used therapeutically in anesthesia, myasthenia gravis, and the treatment of anticholinergic toxidromes.\\nCertain types of mushrooms can also cause cholinergic symptoms.\\nAnticholinergic:\\n This toxidrome should perhaps be more appropriately described as an antimuscarinic\\nsyndrome. Its features include \\ntachycardia\\n due to vagal blockade and \\nhyperthermia\\n (which may be mild to\\nsevere). CNS effects include \\nagitation\\n, \\ndelirium\\n, and in severe cases, seizures. Other peripheral effects\\ninclude \\nmydriasis\\n; \\ndry\\n, flushed skin; \\nurinary retention\\n; and \\ndecreased intestinal motility\\n. These patients\\nclassically demonstrate a “picking” motion. Therapeutic agents that cause this toxidrome include atropine,\\nscopolamine, and antihistamines such as diphenhydramine.\\nOpioids:\\n The opioids produce a classic vital sign combination of \\nrespiratory depression\\n and oxygen\\ndesaturations in conjunction with \\nmiosis\\n, \\ndecreased GI motility\\n, and \\ncoma\\n. Opioids produce this toxidrome\\nby binding to one of the four G protein receptors on the cell membrane, leading to analgesia. However,\\nrespiratory depression, miosis, and physical dependence are secondary, undesirable effects. Other agents\\nthat produce a similar toxidrome include the imidazolines, including clonidine, dexmedetomidine,\\ntetrahydrozoline, and oxymetazoline.\\nSedative hypnotic:\\n The benzodiazepines bind to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the brain and\\ncause a clinical picture of \\nsedation or coma\\n in the setting of \\nnormal\\n vital signs. A common misconception is\\nthat ingested benzodiazepines cause respiratory depression. Although this may be true in the setting of IV\\nadministered benzodiazepines or when benzodiazepines are taken in combination with other agents, patients\\nwith a \\nbenzodiazepine ingestion generally do not develop respiratory compromise\\n.

To tailor the diagnosis, the clinician should focus on a mechanistic\\napproach and check serum \\nketones\\n and \\nlactate\\n. If these are negative and the \\ncreatinine\\n is normal,\\nthen one should suspect the presence of a toxic alcohol and send the appropriate studies.\\nBlood gas:\\n In most cases of intoxication, pH rather than oxygenation is of great relevance. Therefore, it\\nis reasonable to send \\nvenous blood gases (VBGs)\\n rather than arterial\\nblood gases (ABGs) in routine cases of poisoning. However, if adequate oxygenation is a concern (e.g.,\\ncyanide, carbon monoxide poisoning, methemoglobinemia), then an ABG should be sent. Co-oximetry\\ncan be sent from either arterial or venous samples.\\nSerum drug screen:\\n In general, the studies included on this panel include acetaminophen, salicylate,\\nand ethanol concentrations. Rarely, laboratories may include a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) screen.\\nIn practice, the piece of information that is critical on this panel is the serum \\nacetaminophen\\n (\\nN\\n-\\nacetyl-para-aminophenol [APAP]) because patients with this ingestion are often asymptomatic upon\\npresentation and approximately 1 in 500 overdoses have been found to have an unsuspected and\\ntreatable APAP concentration (\\nAnn Emerg Med 1985;14:562\\n).\\nAcute \\nsalicylate\\n ingestions, although very serious, produce a clinical syndrome that is readily\\nidentifiable at the bedside. Chronic salicylate toxicity should be suspected in elderly patients taking\\naspirin who present with altered mental status and tachypnea or patients with an unexplained anion\\ngap metabolic acidosis.\\nEthanol\\n concentrations are \\nnot\\n predictive of intoxication, despite the forensic definition of 80 mg/dL as\\nthe legal limit for driving. Intoxication is a clinical diagnosis. One of the pitfalls of routinely obtaining\\nethanol levels is that serious medical conditions may coexist in these often fragile patients. These\\nconditions are frequently missed when the patient is thought to be drunk. The test is useful to exclude\\nethanol as the cause of altered mental status.\\nTCA\\n screens are notoriously unreliable and cross-react with many therapeutic agents. In the absence\\nof the characteristic ECG findings and vital sign abnormalities, a positive result is meaningless and is\\nthe source of confusion, leading to unnecessary treatment.\\nUrine drug screen:\\n Rarely contributes to the management of the patient. Many of the assays produce\\nfalse-positive or false-negative results and may, in fact, cause harm by leading the clinician to attribute a\\npatient's condition to intoxication rather than a medical emergency. Additionally, these tests are\\nexpensive to conduct and therefore are of limited value in the management of the poisoned patient. The\\nurine drug screen tends to vary between hospitals but often tests for the following substances:\\nAmphetamines:\\n The assay for amphetamines commonly cross-reacts with over-the-counter cold\\nmedications.\\nOpioids:\\n This assay frequently misses the presence of the synthetic opioids such as fentanyl,\\nmethadone, and meperidine; therefore, it is important to rely on the toxidrome for the diagnosis.\\nCocaine:\\n This assay is not directed at the parent compound; rather, it detects the metabolite\\nbenzoylecgonine. Because the parent compound is very short lived, this test is very reliable for the\\nidentification of recent use, but in no way confirms intoxication.\\nCannabinoids:\\n Like cocaine, detection of the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) metabolite is a\\nreliable indicator of use; however, its presence does not have any bearing on the diagnosis of\\nintoxication. In general, synthetic cannabinoids will \\nnot\\n cause a positive test result.\\nBenzodiazepines:\\n The detection of benzodiazepines most commonly relies on the detection of\\noxazepam; therefore, some commonly used benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam) are often missed by\"),\n",

However, the literature regarding\\nthese methods of decontamination suggests that they are of little benefit (\\nMed J Aust 1995;163:345\\n).\\nFurthermore, numerous studies have suggested that patients present approximately 3-4 hours after\\ningestion on average, which tends to make it less likely that there will be a large recovery of pills (\\nAnn\\nEmerg Med 1985;14:562\\n).

The recommended\\nmaximum dose for adults is 4 g/d.\\nClassification\\nAn analgesic. Within the United States, APAP is sold under the trade name Tylenol. The most common trade\\nname for APAP outside the United States is Paracetamol.\\nBecause of its use as an analgesic and antipyretic, APAP has become a common ingredient in various cold\\nand flu remedies. It is also used in the treatment of fevers, headaches, and acute and chronic pain.\\nAPAP is often sold in combination preparations together with NSAIDs, opioid analgesics, or sedatives (e.g.,\\nTylenol #3, Percocet, Vicodin, NyQuil, Tylenol PM).\\nEpidemiology\\nAPAP is the leading cause of toxicologic fatalities per year in the United States, and APAP-induced hepatotoxicity\\nis the most frequent cause of acute liver failure (\\nMed Clin North Am 2008;92(4):761\\n).\\nEtiology\\nAPAP is available as tablets, capsules, liquids, and suppositories. In addition to the more common immediate-\\nrelease form, there is also an extended-release preparation (e.g., Tylenol Arthritis Pain).\\nUnintentional overdosing is more common than intentional ingestion in suicide attempts, especially in elderly\\npatients on chronic pain regimens including several APAP-containing painkillers (\\nHepatol Res 2008;38:3\\n).\\nAll patients with presumed APAP overdose should be adequately assessed, evaluated, and treated. However,\\nonly the minority of poisoned patients require inpatient care (\\nAcad Emerg Med 1999;6(11):1115\\n).\\nPathophysiology\\nAbsorption:\\n APAP serum levels peak 30-60 minutes after oral ingestion; the extended-release\\npreparations peak after 1-2 hours. Absorption is often delayed in overdose, and peak levels are usually\\nreached after 2-8 hours. The overdose kinetics of extended-release APAP are not yet well established.\\nOverdose:\\n The hepatic conjugation pathways become saturated in overdose. A cascade of biochemical\\nchanges occurs in the liver, and centrilobular cell necrosis results (\\nClin Pharmacol Ther 1974;16(4):676\\n).\\nAcetaminophen is metabolized predominantly via glucuronidation (47-62%) and sulfation (25-36%) by\\nphase II metabolism in liver as nontoxic conjugate products. However, a small percentage is\\nmetabolized via oxidation (5-8%) by the cytochrome P450 (2E1) pathway to a toxic metabolite, \\nN\\n-\\nacetyl-\\np\\n-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is conjugated by glutathione to nontoxic cysteine and\\nmercapturic acid conjugates.\\nIn cases of acetaminophen toxicity, the phase II conjugation enzymes are saturated, and a higher\\nfraction of acetaminophen is conjugated via oxidation to NAPQI. The conjugation of NAPQI by\\nglutathione occurs until glutathione is depleted from hepatic reserves, after which the toxic NAPQI and\\nother free radicals accumulate and cause damage to the hepatocytes.'),\n",

In the next 48-72 hours, signs of bone marrow suppression\\nevolve, starting with a profound decline in the leukocyte count and subsequent pancytopenia.\\nBMP:\\n Colchicine poisoning has also been associated with renal failure and adrenal hemorrhage (\\nJ Anal\\nToxicol 1991;15:151\\n); therefore, electrolytes should be monitored.\\nLFTs:\\n Colchicine overdoses have been reported to cause hepatotoxicity; therefore, LFTs should be\\nmonitored.\\nCoagulation studies:\\n Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occasionally occurs; therefore, a full\\npanel, including fibrinogen and fibrin split products, should be obtained.\\nColchicine concentrations:\\n Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index, and plasma concentrations >3\\nng/mL may produce significant toxicity. However, this laboratory test is not readily available, and toxicity\\nshould be suspected if clinical symptoms and laboratory studies are supportive. This test should be\\nthought of as a confirmatory study.\\nOther studies:\\n Creatine kinase (CK; or creatine phosphokinase [CPK]), troponin, lipase, and other\\nelectrolytes should be obtained depending on the clinical scenario.\\nElectrocardiography\\nAn ECG should be obtained at presentation, given the patient's predilection for developing cardiac\\narrhythmias, and the patient should be admitted with continuous cardiac monitoring.\"),\n",

The third-\\ngeneration drugs, including \\nmoclobemide\\n, have a better safety profile.\\nPathophysiology\\nMonoamine oxidase is an enzyme responsible for the inactivation of biogenic amines such as \\nepinephrine\\n,\\nnorepinephrine\\n, \\ntyramine\\n, \\ndopamine\\n, and \\nserotonin\\n. Inhibition of this\\nenzyme results in an increase of synaptic concentrations of biogenic amines. An increase in norepinephrine\\nand serotonin, in particular, is thought to be responsible for mood elevation. MAOIs are structurally similar to\\namphetamine. In overdose, a significant amount of neurotransmitter is released, resulting in a\\nsympathomimetic\\n toxidrome. Phenelzine and isocarboxazid are also hydrazine derivatives and, in\\noverdose, have been associated with the development of \\nseizure\\n activity. As neurotransmitters become\\ndepleted, patients develop cardiovascular collapse, which is often refractory to therapy. Given the fact that\\nMAOIs affect an enzymatic pathway, there is often a \\nsignificant delay\\n in the development of toxicity after\\noverdose, with most cases occurring in a \\n24-hour\\n period after ingestion, although there are cases of toxicity\\noccurring \\nup to 32 hours\\n after overdose (\\nAnn Emerg Med 1984;13:1137\\n). This effect may occur with\\nseemingly small overdoses of five or six pills (\\nJ Clin Psychiatry 1983;44:280\\n).\\nRisk Factors\\nThe classic risk factors for developing toxicity include increasing a prescribed dose or eating foods rich in\\ntyramine\\n, such as aged cheddar cheese or red wine. Drug-drug interactions occur when a new antidepressant\\n(often a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]) is introduced without an adequate \\nwashout period\\n of\\nseveral weeks after discontinuing the MAOI.\\nPrevention\\nPatients should be well educated on the risk associated with these drugs. The \\nduration of action of these\\ndrugs significantly outlasts their half-lives\\n; therefore, physicians should always use a reference guide\\nor consult a pharmacist prior to prescribing a new drug in addition to or as a replacement for the MAOI.\\nAssociated Conditions\\nMAOIs have been associated with severe \\nhypertensive crises\\n in the setting of coingestions of\\ntyramine-\\ncontaining foods such as \\naged cheddar and red wine\\n. Likewise, coingestion of \\nindirect-acting\\nsympathomimetics\\n, which cause presynaptic release of norepinephrine, may precipitate a hypertensive\\ncrisis. Agents included in this category are \\namphetamine-based drugs, dopamine, and\\npseudoephedrine\\n.\\nSerotonin syndrome\\n is also associated with the coingestion of \\nSSRIs\\n, \\nSt. John's wort\\n,\\nmeperidine\\n, and \\ndextromethorphan\\n.\"),\n",

The therapeutic range is\\napproximately 0.6-1.2 mmol/L (or mEq/L).\\nPathophysiology\\nThe mechanism by which lithium exerts its antimanic properties is not well understood. There is some\\nevidence that lithium enhances serotonin function, which may contribute to its mood-stabilizing properties\\n(\\nScience 1981;213:1529\\n).\\nAcute toxicity is associated with the development of a GI illness because lithium is a metal.\\nChronic toxicity is primarily associated with neurologic dysfunction.\\nAlthough serum levels are helpful in the management of these patients, the clinical picture should be the\\nbasis for therapy.\\nGenerally, in \\nchronically\\n exposed patients, levels of less than 2.5 mEq/L are associated with\\ntremulousness, ataxia, and nystagmus.\\nLevels greater than 2.5 mEq/L are associated with a deteriorating neurologic syndrome and are an\\nindication for aggressive intervention including dialysis.'),\n",

Dopamine receptor blockade is also\\nassociated with the development of movement disorders, and the newer neuroleptic agents attempt to\\naddress this by modulating serotonergic tone. Most antipsychotics affect multiple receptors in the nervous,\\nendocrine, and cardiovascular systems, which accounts for a wide range of toxic symptoms.

The newer or “atypical”\\nantipsychotics tend to exhibit less cardiac toxicity, but they often have pronounced α\\n1\\n-antagonism, causing\\nhypotension.

Additionally, at high doses, theophylline is a phosphodiesterase\\ninhibitor, which prolongs the effects of β-agonism by preventing the breakdown of cyclic adenosine\\nmonophosphate (cAMP). Theophylline is also an adenosine antagonist, which in therapeutic doses\\nenhances bronchodilatation. However, in toxic doses, adenosine antagonism is associated with the\\ndevelopment of tachydysrhythmias and seizures.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nClinical Presentation\\nAcute toxicity:\\n Patients with serum concentrations >\\n20 μg/mL\\n will present complaining of \\nnausea\\n and\\nmultiple episodes of \\nvomiting, which may be very difficult to control\\n.
